# Game Overview
Bushido - Risen Sun, is a game of savage battles, of cunning stratagems and last-ditch defences, and where debts of honour are paid in blood. In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, people of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the fabric of the Bushido universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki – and thus the universe itself – is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it – or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the fate of the universe is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?
Bushido is an exciting skirmish game designed for two players using exquisite 32mm miniatures. Take control of heroes or villains and clash with others for control of the Isles of Jwar! They say that the monks record their histories in scrolls and chanting, while the samurai write their legacy in blood, but in an intense game of Bushido, how you write your account is up to you! You’ll take turns moving your models around the battlefield, then rolling dice to see if your well-planned strategies succeed or fail. Bushido is not only about intense melee between razor-sharp swords and fists, but completing intricate Scenarios to score objectives and win the game. Strategy and savagery go hand-in-hand in a game of Bushido, Risen Sun.

# Getting ready
For a game of Bushido, each player will need:
- A copy of these rules.
- A set of Bushido miniatures and their cards.
- A tape measure or a measuring ‘Widget’.
- At least ten six-sided (D6) dice in two different colours. Five in one colour, and five in another.
- Several coins, chips, or dice to track a model’s Ki Tokens during play; some people like to use ten-sided dice for this.
- To protect your cards use plastic card sleeves and a ‘dry wipe’ marker pen.
- An area to play on that is at least 2 foot by 2 foot. Usually, you’ll need a bit more space than this to accommodate dice, cards, snacks, drinks, etc.
- Several bits of terrain. These can vary in size, but no single piece should be larger than 9” x 9”.
- Optionally: Special Attack / Defence Cards for reference and a Bushido Token Set to help track ‘in-game’ states and effects.

# Terms and Concepts
Activating Model: The model as chosen by the Active Player currently resolving its action.

Active Player: The player whose turn it is to activate a model.

Base to Base (BtB): A model is in BtB with another model if their bases are physically touching. An activating model not in BtB already can only enter BtB with 1 Enemy model per activation. Some ranges are specified as BtB rather than in inches.

Battlefield: A game of Bushido takes place on a 2x2’ area we call the Battlefield. Models on the Battlefield or designated as being Elsewhere are in play.

Controller: The player with whom a model is currently Friendly.

Counters: Counters are named for the effect that requires them and may be used to count turn, activations or some other timing effect before they expire.Activation Counters are a particular type of counter. These show how many activations a model can make this turn.

Cover: A model benefits from Cover from an Enemy model if any straight line from the Enemy passes through an Obscuring or Blocking terrain element that is within 1” of the Target model.

Damage: A model is Damaged or takes Damage when it suffers wounds or its wound boxes are marked. Model A deals damage or causes damage when a model has wound boxes marked due to an effect on model A or an action taken by model A.

Damage Roll: A roll using 2D6, applying any negative or positive modifiers then cross-referencing on the Wound Table (p.45) in the column equal to the Success Level of the test, to see the number of wounds inflicted on a model.

Deploy: When a model is first put into play it is Deployed onto the battlefield.  After Terrain is Set Up, any effects that add more terrain to the battlefield may also say they are deployed. This is not a Move or Place. A model may not be Deployed into BtB with an Enemy model or in an Enemy Model’s ZoC (pg.11). (Terrain instead follows the Terrain Rules and any restrictions for the effect putting terrain into play). Models are Deployed with no Activation Counters.

Dice Rolls: Bushido uses ordinary six-sided dice. When a dice is rolled, the number given is referred to as the value on the dice. We use dice in the following ways:
D6: The number shown on a single six-sided dice roll
2D6: Two dice added together to give a value between 2 and 12
D3: Roll a D6. A roll of 1-2=1, 3-4=2, 5-6=3.
D2: Roll a D6. A roll of 1-3=1, 4-6=2.
Some abilities call for a coin flip; this can be represented with a D2 if needed. In some instances a random model or other element may need to be selected, any straightforward method should suffice; assigning each a number then rolling a dice should also work.

Effects: This is a catch-all term for various rules including Ki Feats, Theme bonuses, Unique Effects, Event Cards or others. Usually, for timing we say “Effects that happen in this phase” or similar; this means any rule that says it happens in that phase.

Elsewhere: Elsewhere is a specific place for models in play but not on the Battlefield. These may be Flanking troops, models flying high over the battle or fighting on another plane of existence. Models Elsewhere generate Ki Tokens as usual and are affected by traits and states (such as Regenerate and On Fire). They cannot have Activation Counters, and cannot spend tokens.

Enemy/Friendly: Models can either be Friendly or Enemy models, depending on which player’s Warband they are in; therefore Models in a player’s ‘own’ Warband are considered Friendly, while Models in an Opponent’s Warband are considered Enemy models.

Entering: During any move, the first time a model comes into contact with an area of the battlefield, terrain element or named effect it is considered to Enter that area, terrain or effect. If an effect is over multiple areas or terrain elements (e.g. Void Rifts) the model only Enters the effect the first time it contacts the effect. If a model is Placed into an area of the battlefield, terrain element or named effect it is considered to Enter that area, terrain or effect.

Exhausted: A model with no Activation Counters is considered Exhausted

Facing: A model’s Facing line is directly in the centre of the front of its base. It should be marked with a line or dot on the model’s base. Ninety degrees either side of a model’s facing line shows its Front Arc and should be marked on the model’s base with lines or dots.
A model is Facing anything forward of its Front Arc.
A model is Directly Facing anything in front of its facing line.

Faction: Models have a Faction Icon to denote which of the many warring factions from the Jwar Isles they belong to; therefore, if a rule references a Faction, it refers to the Faction Icon printed on the model’s card.

Initiative: The model with the Initiative checks its Attack dice first in Melee Exchanges and declares the use of Ki Boosts and Ki Feats after their Opponent. The Activating model has the Initiative unless a trait, State or game effect changes this.

In Play: A model is in play when it is on the Battlefield or Elsewhere. A model is not in play when not recruited into the Warband and/or has been Killed or removed from Play.

Ki Boost: A Ki Boost is a special type of Ki Feat that increases statistics.

Killed: When a model has 0 wounds remaining on its Wound Track it is Killed, remove the model from the table.

Line of Sight (LoS): A model can draw LoS to points in its Facing. LoS is achieved if you can draw a straight line from any part of the origin model’s Base to a point in that origin model’s Facing. Terrain and models block LoS except for the following:
- LoS is not blocked by models and Terrain elements smaller than the model LoS is being drawn to.
- LoS is not blocked by models (other than the model you are drawing LoS to) and Terrain elements smaller than the model drawing LoS.
LoS may be checked for any model (Friendly or Enemy) at any time.

Model A has no LoS to Model B since Models E and D are blocking LoS.
Model C is Medium Sized, so has LoS to Model A, likewise Model A has LoS to Model C.

Markers: Markers are used to mark what States are currently affecting a model.

Measuring Distances: The unit of measure in Bushido is inches.
- Movement distances are measured from the nearest base edge to the point the model wishes to move following the route the model’s base will take.
- Targeting distances are measured from the nearest base edge of a model to the nearest base edge of the Target.
- Measurements, whether distances, LoS, or other measurements, may be taken at any time for any reason by either player. In timed play, the player whose clock is running always has priority and should not be obstructed by their opponents’ measuring devices.
- When measuring if a model or point is within a given range then precisely up to that range is considered within. E.g. if the edge of a model’s base is exactly 6” away from its Opponent’s base, it is considered to be within 6”.
- If a range is given as BtB, then the model is in range of itself.

Modifiers: When a statistic is modified it can never go above double its base value. If results are divided and leave fractions, always round down except in the case of distances, where fractions of inches are kept. Numerical values of traits can be modified.
If an effect requires dice to be substituted, the value of the dice is often fixed to some value. It is helpful to physically remove the dice and place it, showing that value, with the dice that were rolled. If a dice is substituted, it cannot be re-rolled. If modifiers, rerolls, adding or removal of dice affect any roll then only after all of these have been resolved can a result be determined.

Movement: Movement is measured using a tape measure (Or other measuring devices). If a model must move Toward another game element (such as another model or Terrain piece), then it cannot increase its distance from that element for any part of its movement. If it must move Directly Toward a game element, then it can only move in a straight line drawn from the centre of its base to the centre of the game element. Similarly, a model which must move Away cannot decrease its distance from that element for any part of its movement. If it must move Directly Away from a game element, then it can only move in a straight line drawn from the centre of its base away from the centre of the game element. An activating model can only enter BtB with one Enemy model per activation.

Open and Hidden Information: In Bushido, all information is ‘open’ unless explicitly stated otherwise; it means that both players are entitled to read any rules, stats, model cards, special cards or any other information pertinent to the game, unless the rules explicitly state the information is hidden. Each player’s Hidden Information should be recorded on one sheet of paper and handed over after the game. If you have a third party, they can be used to check secret information during the game to make sure no mistakes happen.

Owner: A model’s owner is the player who initially recruited the model into their Warband or summoned the model, ignoring any control markers or game effects.

Place: Sometimes Models are Placed on the table instead of moving around the table.

Replace: When a model is replaced, swap the model on the board with the new model.
If the model was not in play, the new model is considered Deployed. The player using the replacing effect chooses the new model’s facing. If the new model has a different sized base, then it must be placed so that the larger base entirely covers the area of the smaller base. If the model being replaced was in BtB with an Enemy model, the new model must be placed in BtB with the Enemy model if possible. When 2 models swap positions, replace each model with the other model.

Return to Play: When returning a model to play the returning model loses all State Markers, Tokens, Counters and game effects. Enhancements remain attached as per the Summon rule, used Enhancements and Ki Feats will remain used if use is limited. Unmark all wound boxes, or if a Kami, gain Ki Tokens equal to maximum Ki.

Select: No LoS is needed to select a model; selecting is not targeting. A model may ‘select’ itself.

Size: Unless a model’s Size is stated as a trait, it is determined by its base.
- Small Base (30mm) = Small Size
- Medium Base (40mm) = Medium Size
- Large Base (50mm) = Large Size
- Huge Base (60mm) = Huge Size
Tiny and Huge models are indicated by Traits. Models with these traits have the given size regardless of base size.

Summon: When a model is Summoned to the game it is added to the warband in addition to the models already recruited. You do not need to pay the Rice Cost of a Summoned model. Some models have Su as their Rice Cost, these can only enter play by being Summoned. 
When a non-unique model is Summoned to the game it never has any Enhancement - Equipment cards attached to its card. If a unique model that was recruited into the warband is Summoned after being removed from the game, it retains any Enhancement - Equipment cards it was recruited with.

Supporting Dice: When making a Test, a maximum of 2 Dice are chosen as supporting dice; these each add +1 to the value of the highest dice roll to get the final result.

Surprised: A model is Surprised if an Activating Enemy model that did not begin its activation in BtB, performs an action that Targets it or brings it into BtB and that Enemy model started outside of LoS and remains outside of LoS during movement. Surprised models may not declare Ki Feats or Ki Boosts, are always the Attacker second in Melee Exchanges, may not benefit from traits or effects that affect Initiative and suffer a -1 Melee Pool modifier.
They may still declare Special Attacks and Defences. Models are only Surprised until the action in which they became Surprised is resolved.
Effects which are not Ki Feats may still be used.

Targeting: A model must be able to draw LoS to another model to Target it. A model may always Target itself.

Test: Whenever a model attempts an action which may succeed or fail, its controlling player rolls dice to complete a Test. The value of the dice rolled will determine if the model succeeds or fails the test.

Timing: Any effect which does not specify when it can be used may be used any time The exception is during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks when the timing is restricted as detailed in the Melee Exchanges and Ranged Attacks section (p.36).
Ki feats that state “when” they may be used can be used only when conditions are met. This can allow them to be used during melee exchanges and ranged attacks outside of the window normally allowed by those sections.
If both players wish to use such effects the active player goes first.
If the trigger for using an effect is occurring while information is hidden then the effect may not be used.

Example: The Corruption of Virtue Event is used when an opponent uses a Virtue Token.  If a Virtue Token is used during a Melee Exchange to add more Special Ability options, this is designated Hidden Information.  By the time the Player discovers the Virtue Token has been spent, the timing window for the trigger has passed and the Event cannot be used.

If an effect does not have a stated expiration time, it ends in the End Phase

Tokens: Tokens are used to track a model’s resources, such as Ki Tokens.

Trap: Only one Trap Effect may be used per activation. The following are considered Traps:
Animal Trap, Pungi Pit Trap, Rope Trap Event Cards
Deference and Snare Ki Feats
Other trap cards released after this rulebook will include text identifying them as Traps.

Virtue Tokens: Many effects give out Virtue Tokens, most commonly the Virtue Trait. This particular type of Token represents different benefits depending on the other models you recruit. When a Virtue Token is spent by the profile which has it, it chooses one of the available abilities.  
Note: The abilities usually say “This model…”. This refers to the model spending the token since that model gains the ability. You read it as if it were reading the spending model’s profile card.
Some models have abilities that can only be used by spending a Virtue Token. When a model spends a Virtue Token you may choose one permitted ability on the card of any Friendly model in play. Note: Some models have abilities that are restricted to a certain group or even specific models; see individual cards for details.

Example:  Hokibo has Virtue abilities that read “...when a Bushi model spends a Virtue Token…” If a model without the Bushi descriptor spends a Virtue Token the options on Hokibo’s card are not available to it.  It could use the abilities on Naigubu’s card because they only specify “...when a Friendly Model spends a Virtue Token…”

Example: Ito Ayako has the Virtue trait. This allows her to give out Virtue Tokens. Ito Kenzo has a Virtue Token. Kenzo can spend the Virtue Token any time he would be able to use an Instant Ki Feat. He declares that he is spending the Virtue Token.  He then consults the other profiles in his Warband. In this case, Ito Ayako and Kauzhiko are in the same Warband. Consulting both profile cards, Kenzo could gain 1 of the following benefits from Ayako’s profile card: 
Looking at Kazuhiko’s card, Kenzo could gain one of the following benefits:
Kenzo can choose from any one of these 5 benefits when he spends his token. Deciding that Lightning Reflexes until the End Phase is what he needs, Kenzo chooses that benefit from Ayako’s card and spends the Virtue Token to gain Lightning Reflexes.

Warband: A player’s Warband consists of recruited, Summoned and Controlled models as well as Special cards.

Zone of Control (ZoC): In Bushido, every model has a ZoC extending 1” from the edge of its base to any point within its LoS.
Models ignore Friendly ZoCs, but once a model enters an Enemy model’s ZoC it may only move either directly towards that model, or directly away until it leaves the ZoC.
Models beginning their activations in one or more Enemy model’s ZoC must do one of the following:
Declare a Stand Up action
Declare an action that allows them to move into BtB with one of those models and move directly toward the enemy model until they reach BtB
Declare another action that allows a move
They must move directly away from the Enemy model until they leave the ZoC; or away from all models until they leave all Enemy model’s ZoC if in multiple ZoCs, after which they can move freely.
Models can ignore the ZoC of Models that are in BtB with Enemy models for movement and declaring or performing actions (such as Ranged Attack Actions or Scenario Actions which otherwise cannot be performed in a ZoC).
If a model moves out of BtB, then it may ignore the ZoC until that move is completed.

# Cards
## Profile Cards
Profile cards contain all the rules specific to all models represented by that card. You may also use the profile card to keep track of the wounds sustained by your model(s), Ki Tokens and game effects.

1. Name: The name of the model(s). If this card represents a unique individual character rather than one or more generic profiles, this has a special border, and the Rice Cost is coloured Gold.
2. Elemental Icons: Some models are aspected towards one or more of the six elements:
 Earth  Water
 Fire  Metal
 Air  Void
3. Base Size & Max Symbol: If a profile has multiple base size symbols any of the available options are permitted.
Profile Cards without wound tracks have a MAX symbol on the back. Whenever a rule refers to the number of wound tracks use the MAX number instead. You can recruit up to this number of these models into a warband.
4. Type: The type indicates all the keywords that refer to the model. A model can have multiple types, these are separated by commas, and a model is always all of its types.
The Name and Types of models can often be referred to by other rules. Traits often have a [Type] that singles out what models the trait affects. This [Type] can also be a model’s name. Plural words are considered the same type as the same singular word for cards with multiple wound tracks.
5. Statistics: The number is the model’s base statistic value. Some effects modify a statistic, but it can never go above double its base value. If a statistic is 0, it can be modified to a maximum of 1.
If a “-” icon represents a statistic, then it counts as 0 but cannot be modified by positive or negative modifiers. 
Some models may have a Ki boost icon to the side of the Statistic value. This is the Statistic’s Boost cost. This is the cost in Ki Tokens to increase the Statistic by 1. Boosts remain only for the current Test or Movement. A player may increase a Statistic multiple times (to a maximum of double its base Statistic), as long as there are Ki Tokens available to do so. Boosts are considered Ki Feats.
  a) Melee Pool Statistic: This is the number of dice the model uses when resolving an Opposed Melee test.
  b) Ranged Pool Statistic: This is the number of dice the model uses when resolving a Ranged Attack. 
Note: Many models will have some Ranged pool statistic even if they do not have a ranged weapon. Perhaps they can be bought a ranged weapon or use the ability in some other way.
  c) Move Statistic: The distance the model can move in inches when it makes a movement that specifies this distance. Also, the number of dice rolled for a Move Test.
Types
Example: Aiko; Unsui, Monk, Shugenja is a Temple of Ro-Kan model.
The Silverback’s trait Bodyguard[Aiko](3”) works on her because her name is Aiko.
An Enemy Kyuubi would gain the bonus for Vengeance because she is a Shugenja.
She can be included in the Righteous Warriors theme because she is a Monk.
In addition, she is Unsui and so not a model affected by Ume’s Mentor rule. Example: Both Kintaru and Fishermen of the Ro-Kan are Fisherman models. Kintaru, because he has it in his type, Fisherman of the Ro-Kan because it’s in the name.
  d) Ki Statistic/Maximum Ki Limit: The Ki statistic is actually 2 statistics represented by 2 numbers written X/Y. The X number is the model’s Ki statistic. This tells you the amount of Ki Tokens each model represented by this card generates during the Starting Phase and the number of dice it uses for Opposed and Challenge Ki tests.
 The second Y number is the model’s Ki Limit, the maximum number of Ki Tokens each model represented by this card can have at any one time. If it would gain more than this, any excess is discarded.
6. Wounds Track: The number of wounds a model can suffer. When a model suffers wounds an equal amount are marked from its Wound Track. When a model is reduced to 0 wounds remaining on its Wound Track it is Killed; remove the model from the table. When a model Heals wounds, it recovers marked wounds from its Wound Track. A model cannot Heal more than it has marked wounds. 
Some cards have multiple Wound Tracks to use for multiple identical models. The number of Wound Tracks is the limit to how many of these models you may recruit or Summon into a Warband, either at Warband Creation or during the game.
Some Profile Cards, such as Kami models, have a Max symbol on the back next to their Size. These Profile cards are usually ones that have no wound tracks. Whenever a rule refers to the number of Wound Tracks use the Max number instead if the card has one. You can recruit up to this number of these models into a Warband.
7. Traits: Each model may have several traits that describe how it behaves in the game. This makes those traits easier to find when you need them. Some traits are Weapon Traits; these are listed on the model’s weapon grid and are only in effect when using that weapon.
8. Ki Feats: Ki Feats available to the model(s).
9. Melee and Ranged Weapon Grids: All models in Bushido have a melee weapon, though for many they are fists and feet or claws and teeth. Some also have a ranged weapon. The weapon grid also lists any weapon traits that are in effect when using that weapon, as well as any special attacks and defences that are available when using that weapon:
  a) Designates the weapon as either a Melee or Ranged Attack weapon. Ranged Weapons have Range Bands.
    - Short Range (first value): Ranged Attacks against Targets up to and including this distance are at Short Range.
    - Medium Range (second value): Ranged Attacks against Targets beyond Short Range and up to and including this distance are at Medium Range.
    - Long Range (third value): Ranged Attacks against Targets beyond Medium Range and up to and including this distance are at Long Range.
    - Ranged Attacks against Targets at distances exceeding the weapon’s Long Range automatically fail.
  b) A weapon’s Strength modifier to any Damage Rolls made by this weapon. (Sp) Indicates a special effect instead of a standard damage roll The attack does no damage, some of these weapons have properties detailed in the Unique Effects section of the model’s profile card.
  c) Any Traits associated with the weapon.
  d) Any Special Attacks and Defences available when using that weapon.
10. Faction symbol: Which Faction the model belongs to. Some models are from the Ronin Faction. Your Warband can only recruit models that belong to your chosen Faction or Ronin models recruitable by your chosen faction as indicated on the Ronin model’s card.
11. Unique Effects: Any additional rules that are not Traits or Feats.
  a) Traits Reminder Text: Starter set cards have reminder text for all their traits. Remember this is just a reminder of the rule; the full version is in this rulebook, always look up the complete rules text if there is an issue mid game for clarification.
12. Rice Cost: The cost to recruit this model into your Warband. 
Models with Su are Summoned models that enter play during the game through a Ki Feat or Unique Effect and cannot be recruited when creating your Warband. 
Models with Sp are models with a special rule which will be explained on its profile card and cannot be recruited when creating your Warband. 
If a card’s Rice Cost is followed with ea, then more than one model represented by that card may be recruited into your Warband. Each model recruited pays the cost specified. If a model’s Rice Cost is increased or decreased by a Theme list or other rule, the original printed Rice Cost is still used for all game effects relying on the Model’s Rice Cost.

## Special Cards
Faction decks include special cards specific to each faction, with a Ronin set of special cards available to all. Each card can be recruited X times per Warband based on its Max (X) trait. If a card has no printed Max (X) trait, it is assumed to be Max (1).
There are three types of Special cards that players can recruit when creating their Warband - Enhancements, Events, and Terrain. Each type acts differently in how and what they affect during the game. These are explained in detail below, but all special cards are comprised of the following features:
1. Name: The card’s name.
2. Faction: Special cards may only be purchased if they have the same Faction symbol as the Warband, or the Ronin Faction symbol.
3. Type: This specifies if it is an Event, Enhancement or Terrain card.
4. Description: Describes the card’s effects.
5. Traits: Traits that apply to that card.
6. Rice Cost: The cost to recruit the card for the Warband. If the cost is variable its X value is chosen and locked at Warband Creation. Costs cannot be modified below 1 Rice.
Some cards say to Discard the card after a specific trigger happens. A Discarded Special card has no effect on the game from that point onward.

### Enhancement Cards
The player must decide which profile card an Enhancement card is Attached to during the creation of their Warband. During play, place an Attached Enhancement card under the chosen profile card. The model(s) will benefit from the effects detailed on the card for as long as it is Attached to the model(s)’ profile card.
Models with the Insignificant trait cannot have Enhancement cards Attached to their profile cards during Warband creation. Animal, Construct, Kami and Swarm models may only have Enhancement cards that specifically name them as Required.
Some models have multiple profile cards. If a card says X and Y are considered the same model when creating a Warband, then any Enhancement cards bought for either card are moved to the one starting in play before the game.
Some cards represent multiple models and have multiple wound tracks. Enhancement cards will specify if they can be bought for such models multiple times or can only be bought for a single model on the card. In the case of enhancements applied to a single model on a card representing multiple models, the enhanced model must be distinguishable from otherwise identical models without the enhancement.

Enhancement Card Traits:
Equipment: This represents a physical item. A model may have only one Equipment card attached to it.

Max (X): This card can be purchased for a Warband up to X times.

Requirement [Type]: This card can only be Attached to this type of model.

Exclusion [Type]: This card cannot be Attached to this type of model.

### Event Cards
Event cards are played once, at a time detailed on the card. Once the card is resolved, then it is discarded and removed from the game. 
Unless stated otherwise Event Cards are used in the same way as Instant Ki Feats (p.56). They are not, however, considered to be Ki Feats.
Some event cards may result in another special card being put into play, often as a result of some action on the table. In these cases, the other special card will be printed on the reverse side of the Event card and can only be recruited in this way.

Event Card Traits:
Max (X): This card can be purchased for a Warband up to X times.

Requirement [Type]: This card is restricted in how it can be played or recruited and requires a [Type] of model or specifies another restriction.

### Terrain Cards
Terrain cards allow a player to deploy a specified Terrain element on the table during the player’s normal Deployment of their Warband. Terrain elements deployed due to Terrain cards must follow standard rules for Terrain element deployment unless stated on the card.
If restrictions mean that the terrain cannot be deployed, the opposing player must make as small an alteration as possible to allow the bought terrain to be placed.

Terrain Card Traits:
Destructible: model in base contact with  this terrain and not in an enemy model’s ZoC can declare a Wait Action to remove it from the Battlefield. Models that are Aloof, Animal, Insignificant or have a Max Ki Limit of 0 cannot perform this effect. This will not trigger effects listed on Friendly terrain.

Max (X): This card can be purchased for a Warband up to X times.

Requirement [Type]: This card is restricted in how it can be played or recruited and requires a [Type]  model.

### Communal Cards 
Some factions have access to a Communal Card. These cost no Rice and can always be recruited.  You may only recruit one Communal Card with the same name.

Example:  A warband has recruited Bakemono Horde “Out of the Underworld” so it may not recruit the Bakemono Horde “The Shadow Council” communal card.

Some Communal Cards are used to pool together all the Ki generated by their community profiles. If this is the case, all community profiles will have a maximum Ki listed as *.
Such models never have Ki, effects that would gain them Ki, including Channel, Leech, Ki Generation, the Focus Action or any Ki Feats or other effects instead add Ki to the communal card.
Community Profiles with a * for maximum Ki are not subject to abilities that remove Ki from them.  For example they cannot be Leeched from and the Psychic Drain Ki Feat has no effect.
Some Communal Cards may grant other abilities, similar to Unique Effects on a profile card. Some Communal Cards add new feats to the community profiles.  Always read these as if they were printed on the profile card.

### Theme List Cards
A player can only use one Theme per Warband. Themed lists allow you to trade restrictions in Warband composition for other bonuses during gameplay. Unless otherwise stated, Themes’ benefits only affect Friendly models.

Example: Aiko is recruited into the Righteous Warriors Theme, Silverback can now be recruited even though animals, gorillas and Silverback are not listed in the Permitted models.

Theme Card Traits:
Permitted (Type): Only models with a matching type can be recruited into this Warband, Ronin models of the type may only be included if the theme states Ronin of that type are permitted.
If a Theme list card does not have this trait, all models from the chosen Faction are available to recruit into the theme.
If a Ronin Theme list card does not have this trait, all models from the chosen Faction and all Ronin available to that Faction are available to recruit into the theme.

Exclusion (Type): Models with a matching type cannot be recruited into this Warband.
If a profile qualifies for both the Permitted and Exclusion of a theme, the Exclusion takes priority, and the model may not be recruited.
Some models or special cards, when recruited into a Warband, permit other models to be recruited. Other models may require a specific model to be recruited into the Warband before they can be included. If a model is permitted in a Theme then any model it allows to be recruited is also allowed in the theme regardless of any Exclusion. 
If a model or special card is permitted in a theme list, any model summoned by that model is also allowed to be summoned.

Theme Benefits:Unless otherwise stated, Theme benefits only affect Friendly models.

# The Rules
This section covers the rules of the game.
### Rule #1: Rules Conflicts
When two rules come into direct conflict, use the following order of precedence to determine how to proceed:
1. If one rule (Rule A) references another rule (Rule B) by name, then Rule A takes priority. If this does not resolve the conflict, then move on to step 2 below.
2. Rules that prevent something happening take priority over rules that force something to happen. If this does not resolve the conflict, then move on to step 3 below. 
3. If multiple effects happen at the same time:
a. If both Effects belong to the same player, that player determines the order they are resolved.
b. If the Effects belong to different players, the Active Player chooses the order to resolve them.

Example: Kenko uses Slam Attack on Manu. Manu has the Immovable Trait. Slam Attack makes no reference to Immovable, & vice versa - so test 1 does not resolve this. As per test 2, since Immovable is stopping an effect from happening, it takes priority over the Slam rules so Manu is not moved or made Prone.

# Warband Composition
To recruit a Warband, players must choose a Rice Limit and a Faction to play.
The Rice Limit determines the size of the game and can be arbitrarily chosen. While you can play games with any amount of Rice you will find the following standard formats:
- 70 rice, Introductory level suggested for quicker games.
- 100 rice, Standard game format and suggested level for events.
A Warband may not be of the Ronin Faction. A player’s Warband in Bushido is made up of several models, and any Special cards from the same Faction and may include Ronin that may be recruited by that Faction. 
The Rice Cost of your Warband must come to the total agreed upon with your Opponent. A Player can only recruit one of each card; this does not prohibit the Opponent from recruiting the card for their Warband. Sometimes two or more models are represented by the same profile card. A player can choose to recruit as many models as there are Wound tracks, or up to the Max value, on the matching profile card.
Some models are represented by more than one model and profile card. Such models are considered to be the same model when creating a Warband.
Start the game using the model and profile card with a rice cost. Deploy that model unless the profile allows the option to select which model to deploy. Other profile cards and models relating to the same model are not in play until an effect allows them to replace a model in play or enter elsewhere.
Unless otherwise stated, if one such model is replaced with another, transfer all State Markers, Tokens, Counters, Enhancements and game effects to the newly deployed model in play on the battlefield deployed using the Replace rules.  Mark or unmark wound boxes on the new profile, or as otherwise directed, to match the replaced model’s marked wound boxes. If the replace was the result of a Ki Feat that ends in the end phase, this replace will not expire in the end phase unless noted on the profile card.
If models are replaced within an Action, this replacement will resolve the removed model’s part of the Action, then complete the remaining Action steps with the new model and profile. Remove an Activation Counter from the new model following the Action steps, if required, to resolve the declared Action.
Only one profile card will have a Rice Cost. If needed during a game, use the unadjusted Rice Cost printed on whichever profile card has a Rice Cost. 
If your models are considered to be the same model when recruiting a Warband, then, if chosen as VIM, those models are all considered to be VIM.

Example: Kota’s Human Form is chosen as a VIM. If she is replaced with her Fox Form, then Kota’s Fox Form is still the VIM.

### Ronin models
Ronin represent wanderers, mercenaries, diplomats, outcasts and other individuals who may fight for more than one Faction. From three Imperial Princesses expecting hospitality from the Tengu to Sojobo leaving his people without a King to seek the enlightenment of the Temple. Ronin each have different motivations for working with many Factions, but all follow these rules.
a) Ronin models can be included in Warbands of multiple different factions. Ronin models may be recruited into any Warband of a faction that is listed on the Ronin card either by faction symbol or in words.

b) Ronin are NOT considered to be of the faction of the Warband they are recruited into for game effects. If an effect specifies it works only on Faction models, then it does not work on Ronin. 
c) Ronin can only have Ronin Enhancement cards and cannot be included in any Faction theme lists unless the theme specifies Ronin of that type.
d) Ronin can be included in Ronin Theme Lists.
e) It is permissible to make a list for a given faction that includes only Ronin models that work for that Faction, but when creating a Warband, you cannot choose Ronin as your Faction.

Example: A Prefecture list using the Blood of the Dragon theme can include Samurai but cannot include Golden Sentinel models as the theme does not include Ronin Samurai.
Example: It is possible to create a Warband entirely made of Ronin. First choose a faction (Prefecture, Ito, etc…) and choose Ronin available to that faction. It is not a “Ronin Faction” list as this is not permitted.

# Game Setup & Turn
## Game Setup
Before starting the first Turn, players need to set up the game using the following steps:
1. First, each player should create a Warband.
2. Then either agree on or randomly decide, a Scenario to play.
3. Players deploy/nominate any Scenario Objectives as instructed by the Scenario.
4. Players deploy Terrain and then select Deployment Zones.
 When deploying Terrain elements, follow these three steps:
a. Players should make a Deployment Tactical Test; the winner decides which player is Player 1. Player 1 sets up a terrain element first. 
b. Players alternate in choosing Terrain elements until at least six elements are deployed. You may continue adding more terrain elements after this, but if one player chooses to stop, the other may only deploy one final terrain piece.
c. The player who chose to stop placing terrain then chooses one of the Deployment Zones as dictated by the scenario.
- No Impassable Terrain element may be deployed within a Scenario or Deployment Zone.
- No Impassable Terrain element may be deployed within 2” of a Scenario Objective or another Terrain element with the Impassable trait.
5. The Winner of the Deployment Tactical Test deploys terrain that is part of their Warband first, followed by the second player deploying terrain from their Warband.
6. Players simultaneously Declare or Record any VIMs.
7. Player 1 then decides which player deploys first; that player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario. The second player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario.
8. The First Turn then begins.

## A Game Turn
Games of Bushido are broken down into a number of Turns. How many Turns the game lasts is dictated by the Scenario being played.
Each game Turn is divided into three Phases. The three Phases are the Starting Phase, the Main Phase and the End Phase.

### Starting Phase
1. Tactical Test: Resolve the Tactical Test. The successful Player chooses who is Active for the Starting and End Phases this turn, and Active Player first in the Main Phase.
2. Non-Active Player rolls for Variable Turns.
3. Ki Generation: All models generate a number of Ki Tokens equal to the first number of their Ki Statistic.
4. All models gain 2 Activation Counters each.
5. Resolve any effects which happen “In the Starting Phase”.  The Active Player resolves their Starting Phase effects first in the order they choose.  Then the non-Active player resolves their Starting Phase Effects in the order the non-Active Player chooses.
6. Players calculate the number of Pass Tokens for the Turn. Each player totals the number of models in their Warband. The player with the least gains the difference in Pass Tokens.


If at any point in the Main Phase either player has no models left in play, immediately move to the End Phase.

### Main Phase
1. Starting with the Player chosen to go first via the Tactical roll.
2. The player becomes the Active Player.
From this point, the Active Player may use Active Feats.
3. The Active Player chooses a model in their Warband and declares a Simple or Complex action for it to perform.
 Alternatively, the player may spend a Pass Token instead of taking an action with one of their models, if they do, skip to step 5. Players must activate a model if they have models with activation counters available unless they spend a pass token.
4. The model’s action is resolved.
5. The Active player may use Active Feats for the last time this activation.
6. The Opponent then becomes the Active Player and follows from Step 2. If the Opponent is unable to activate any models, then the current player continues to be the Active Player until they are also unable to activate any models.
7. Once neither player can activate a model, move to the End Phase.

### End Phase
1. Resolve any effects that occur in the End Phase (Other than those expressly stated to resolve in another step). Always resolve the adverse effects first.
2. Resolve states that cause Damage in the End Phase (Fire, Bleeding, Poison).
3. Effects that expire in the End Phase now expire.
4. Refer to the Scenario being played and check for the scoring of Scenario Points and then Victory Points. If this is the final Turn, or if all available Victory Points have been scored, the game ends (games can only end in the End Phase). 
If either player has no models left in play, the game ends, and Victory Points are calculated immediately.
5. Discard any unspent Pass Tokens.

# Movement & placing
Models can move around the board in a number of ways depending on the action chosen when the model activates or the effects applied to those models. Some models are naturally faster than others, represented by their Move statistic and Move Boost; many models also have abilities or Ki Feats which allow them to move. Any model may use different types of movement by choosing the requisite action; some effects also allow movement; the effect will tell you how the model moves. Effects that are triggered by movement can trigger from any of these. 
If a model would be moved past the edge of the game area, then it stops when its base touches the edge of the board. A model cannot be Placed with any part of its base off the board edge.

Move
The model moves up to the given distance, along any path, subject to the restrictions for the action or ability that permits a move and may change its Facing at the end of the movement. Changing Facing is considered a movement, even if the model remains in the same place. During this movement, the model’s base may not pass through another model’s base or impassable terrain. If an effect allows a player to move an opponent’s model, its facing may not be changed unless the effect specifically states otherwise.

Walk
The model may make a move up to the distance stated (If no distance is given, the walk is up to the model’s Move Statistic in inches) in any direction. A model performing a Walk may not move into an Enemy ZoC or move into or out of BtB with an Enemy model. If an effect allows a player to walk an opponent’s model, that player chooses its facing at the end of the walk.

Run
The model may choose a point within its LoS then rotate to face that point. The model may then make a movement in a straight line, directly towards that point. A model may not Run into an Enemy model’s ZoC, into BtB with an Enemy model, or change its Facing after the movement.

Charge
The model Targets an Enemy model, moving up to double its Move Statistic towards that model in a straight line which would bring its base into contact with the Target’s base or ZoC.
During this movement, it may not contact an enemy ZoC other than the Target’s. If this movement would cause it to contact another Enemy model’s ZoC, its movement stops immediately before that ZoC. Once in contact with the Targeted model’s ZoC or if the targeted model is in the acting model’s ZoC, the charging model may ignore the ZoC of other Enemy models.
Once the charging model contacts the Target model’s ZoC, it must move directly towards the target until it is in BtB. This movement need not be along the straight path of the charge movement.

Place
Placing a model is not considered Movement. Just pick up the model and place it in its new permitted location. It does not have a move path, and it ignores ZoC, models and terrain between it, and its final location. If a model is Placed, it cannot be placed into the area of an Impassable Terrain Element, another model or into BtB with an Enemy model. Each specific Place effect may have further restrictions. The player Placing the model decides the model’s Facing.

# Actions
Models in Bushido perform actions to affect the game. The actions a model can take depend on the number of Activation counters on that model and whether it’s in BtB with an Enemy model.
If a model cannot legally declare any actions (due to states, traits or other game effects) when chosen to activate the model immediately becomes exhausted.
Models in BtB with an Enemy model may not declare Actions or Ki Feats with the  icon.
If a model performs an action with 
the  icon then it may not perform a walk alongside the action.

Example: Hanso uses his Command trait on 2 Yarimen. Both Yarimen declare a melee action. As Command specifies a Simple Action, the Yarimen lose an Activation Counter each.

Example: Hanso uses his “Move it!” Ki Feat on two Yarimen. Both Yarimen make a Walk up to their Move Stat in inches, but this is not a Walk Action, so they do not lose an Activation Counter.

The Active Player chooses which model they are activating (the Activating Model) and what Simple or Complex action the model will take.
During a model’s action in which the declared action becomes invalid or impossible to complete, it instead reverts to the position it was in when it declared the action. It then removes one Activation Counter, even if the declared action was Complex. The activation is then considered to be complete.

### Condition
During the Starting Phase, each model gains 2 Activation Counters. Each time a player becomes the active player, they choose one model with activation counters to perform an action. Once a simple action is completed, remove 1 Activation Counter. Once a complex action is completed remove 2 Activation Counters. If a model participates in a Melee exchange has Activation Counters, it loses 1 Activation Counter for participating in the Melee Exchange in addition to the Activating model who performs the Melee action.
If an effect says a model makes an Action, such as a Walk Action or other Standard Action, even as part of a larger effect or another model’s activation, it loses an Activation Counter. If the effect allows the model to Walk, Melee or other effect but does not make an Action, then it does not lose an Activation Counter.
A model with no Activation counters is Exhausted and cannot be chosen to activate. If a model has only one Activation counter, it cannot declare a complex action.
Exhausted models cannot be chosen to activate, but can still participate in Melee Exchanges.

## Nested Activations
Effects such as Pack and Group Traits or use of the Command Action allows multiple models to activate at once.  It is not permitted for models activated using such effects to then also use those effects.

Example:  Tsuki uses her Pack trait on Gorak and Kite. Gorak may not use his Pack Trait to also activate Muna.

## Standard Actions
Standard actions in the game fall into two categories - Simple or Complex. Simple Actions remove one Activation Counter, while Complex Actions remove two Activation Counters. Traits and Unique effects may grant other actions, but they are not considered Standard actions.

### Simple Actions
Melee Action: Select an enemy model. The Activating model must attempt to enter BtB with the Enemy model by moving up to its Move Statistic in inches. During this movement, it may only enter into the ZoC of the model with whom it is attempting to enter BtB. However, while within that model’s ZoC or if the selected model is in the acting model’s ZoC it may ignore other Enemy models’ Zones of Control.
If at the end of its movement, it is in BtB with the selected Enemy model, it must resolve a Melee Exchange. 
Models that start their activation in BtB with a single Enemy model may only move around that Enemy model’s base, ignoring the ZoC of enemy models. They may enter BtB with a different chosen model as part of this move. After moving a Melee 
Exchange is resolved with the chosen model in BtB.
Models that start their activation in BtB with a single Enemy model may only move around that Enemy model’s base, ignoring the ZoC of enemy models. They may enter BtB with a different selected model as part of this move. This movement is not limited by the model’s Move Statistic. After moving, a Melee Exchange is resolved with the selected model in BtB.

Note you only remove one activation counter from a model for declaring a melee action and being involved in the resulting melee exchange.

Disengage Action: Choose one enemy model in BtB with the activating model. The activating model resolves a Melee Exchange against that model. It must allocate at least as many dice to Defence as to Attack, and if unable to do this (E.g. the model is Aggressive) then it may not attempt a Disengage Action. If the Activating model successfully defends or ends the exchange, not in BtB with the chosen model, after the Melee is resolved, it may make a Walk up to its Move Statistic in inches, ignoring all models in BtB.
Simple Ki Feat Action: The Activating model may attempt a Simple Ki Feat listed on its profile card. Some Ki Feats have the  or  Icons; these icons apply to this action if the chosen Ki Feat has them.
Ranged Attack Action:  The Activating model makes a Ranged Attack , targeting an Enemy model and may make a Walk up to its move in inches either before or after the Ranged Attack is resolved; you must declare whether you will walk as part of declaring the action. The model cannot make a Ranged Attack while in BtB or within the ZoC of an Enemy model. A model making a Ranged Attack may be referred to as “The Attacker”.
Run Action:  The model may make a Run up to 1.5 x its Move Statistic in inches.
Simple Scenario Action:    The model may not be in BtB with an Enemy model, or in an Enemy’s ZoC, and must be in BtB with a Scenario Objective. Turn the Activating model to face the objective directly. See the specific Scenario to resolve any other effects of the Action.
Stand Up Action:     This action may only be declared if the Activating model is Prone. The model removes its Prone State marker and may change its Facing. After removing the marker, if the model is in BtB with an Enemy model, then resolve a Melee Exchange with a -1 Melee Pool penalty.
Wait Action:   The Activating model takes no other action. Instead, it may choose one of the listed effects triggered by taking the Wait Action.
- Remove all Stunned Markers
- Remove all Immobilised Markers
- Remove up to 2 Fire Markers
- Remove a Reload Marker
- An effect triggered by a Wait action, specified on the model’s card or a special card.
- Remove a piece of Destructible Terrain which the activating model is in BtB contact with from the table. Models that are Aloof, Animal, Insignificant or have a Maximum Ki Limit of 0 cannot perform this effect. This will not trigger effects listed on Friendly terrain.
Walk Action:  The Activating model may make a Walk up to its Movement Statistic in inches.

### Complex Actions
Charge Action:  The Activating model makes a Charge move.
If a model does not have enough movement to achieve BtB with its Target, then it cannot declare a charge action on that target. After moving into BtB, a Melee Exchange is resolved. For this Melee Exchange, the charging model gains +2 to its first Damage Roll.
Complex Ki Feat Action: The Activating model may attempt a Complex Ki feat listed on its profile card. Some Ki Feats have the  or  Icons; these icons apply to this action if the chosen Ki Feat has them.
Focus Action:    The Activating model gains the number of Ki Tokens equal to its Ki Statistic.
Complex Scenario Action:  The model may not be in BtB with an Enemy model or in an Enemy’s ZoC and must be in BtB with a Scenario Objective. Turn the Activating model to face the objective. See the specific Scenario to resolve any other effects of the Action.

If a model’s action becomes invalid or illegal after the model’s action has been declared, that model’s activation ends immediately and it loses one Activation Counter, regardless of the action declared.
If an effect or Ki Feat causes a model’s activation to end directly (Mirage, Snare, etc) follow that effect’s rules instead.

# Tests
To see whether a model’s action is successful, and how successful, often requires a test.
There are two types of tests in Bushido, Opposed and Challenge. Both tests involve rolling D6’s. Opposed tests pit both players against each other, while Challenge Tests require one player to roll dice against a Challenge Number.
If the result on a dice is a natural 1 (After rerolls) then it is ignored when calculating the result of the dice roll, it is removed from the pool entirely and does not count for tiebreakers when counting the number of dice rolled. If all dice rolled result in 1’s, then the final result is considered 0. 
If, naturally or because of negative modifiers, a model’s Statistic value used for an Opposed or Challenge test is 0 or less the player still rolls a single dice. In Opposed tests, both players gain a dice in their pool until both players have at least one dice.

Example: Wu-Zang has a base melee pool of 1. In a melee exchange, Wu-Zang is Exhausted and has a Stunned Marker. His current Melee Pool is -1. His opponent, Jin has 3 Melee Pool. Both players gain two dice to bring Wu-Zang up to one dice and his opponent to 5 dice.

Remember that two numbers represent a model’s Ki, the Ki Statistic and the Maximum Ki Limit. When conducting tests relying on the Ki Statistic, the Maximum Ki Limit is not relevant.


Example: Hanzo has a Ki Statistic of 2 and a Maximum Ki Limit of 6, represented as 2/6 on his profile card. When Hanzo takes a test relying on the Ki Statistic, his dice pool is two before any modifiers.

When declaring the use of Ki Feats (Including Ki Boosts) during any test, the Opponent declares first and the Activating model or the Model with the Initiative if in a Melee Exchange, declares second.

### Conducting Re-Rolls
If dice must be re-rolled, then re-rolls should be conducted in the following order with Model A being the model with the initiative or the Activating model, and Model B being the Opponent:
1. Model B picks any of Model A’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled. Model B then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
2. Model A picks any of Model B’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled. Model A then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.

## Opposed Tests
These type of tests require two models to roll a number of dice equal to the Statistic value for the test. For an Opposed Melee Test, for example, you would roll a number of dice equal to the models’ Melee Pool Statistics. Opposed Tests are resolved in the following order:
1. The models calculate their dice pools, deciding if they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or increase the Statistic being used through a Ki Boost. The Active player declares second.
2. Both players then roll their dice and conduct any re-rolls.
3. Both players remove any dice with a value of 1.
4. The models apply any modifiers necessary to their highest dice result rolled. Next, up to two additional dice that were not removed contribute +1 per dice to the final result of the roll. These additional dice are called Supporting Dice.
5. The final results are then compared, the successful model being the one with the highest final result. If one model is successful, the other is not. The difference between the final results is the Success Level of the test.
In the case of final results being equal, tiebreakers are used in the following order:
1. The player who rolled the highest number of dice (subtracting rolls of 1 from the total) wins.
2. Otherwise, the Active Player wins.


## Challenge Tests
These type of tests require one model to roll a number of dice equal to the Statistic value for the test. These will be called out with a Challenge Number in brackets, for example, Ki Challenge Test (5) or Move Challenge Test (6). The Challenge Number is the number that must be equalled or exceeded by the final result of the dice rolled. If no Statistic is specified, then the Challenge test is made using a single D6. The Challenge Number can also be modified; it is possible for the Challenge number to be zero or negative.

### Rolling a Challenge Test
1. Calculate the model’s dice pool, deciding if they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or increase the Statistic being used through a Ki Boost.
2. Roll the dice and conduct any re-rolls.
3. Remove any dice with a value of 1.
4. Apply any modifiers necessary to the highest dice result rolled. Next, up to two additional dice that were not removed contribute +1 per dice to the final result of the roll. These additional dice are called Supporting Dice.
5. The final result is then compared to the Challenge Number; if the Result equals or exceeds the Challenge Number, the Challenge Test is Successful. For tests requiring a Success Level, the difference between the final result and the Challenge Number is the Success Level for the test.

## Size Challenge Tests
A Size Challenge Test is a Challenge Test using a model’s Size in place of a Statistic. A model taking a Size Challenge Test rolls a number of dice based on its size as shown in the table below. Modifiers are then applied to the result of the roll if applicable.

| Size | Number of Dice |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny | 1 |
| Small | 2 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Large | 4 |
| Huge | 5 |

| Trait | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Strong | +1 |
| Weak | -1 |
| Swarm | -1 |

## Tactical Tests
Tactical tests occur at deployment and at the beginning of every turn (p24). Both players nominate a model to perform an Opposed test using a single D6 (applying any modifiers from traits).
In the case of a tie after checking the number of Dice, there is no Active Player during this roll, so the test must be taken again.

## Fear Challenge Tests
Fear tests are Challenge tests using the model’s Ki Statistic. Any effects that affect Ki Challenge Tests also affect Fear Tests.
Models with the Fear (X) trait, automatically pass Fear tests with a Challenge Number equal to or lower than their Fear (X) trait. They still take a Fear test if the Challenge Number is higher than their Fear (X) trait.
Resolve a Fear Test when:
1. An Activating model declares an action or effect that would bring it into BtB with an Enemy model with the Fear trait. If the Activating model fails the Fear test, regardless of the action declared, remove one activation counter, and its activation ends. It does not enter the Frightened State.
2. An Activating model with the Fear trait declares an action that would bring it into BtB with an Enemy model. If the Enemy model fails its Fear test then it enters the Frightened State

# Ranged Attacks
A model must have a ranged weapon to make a Ranged Attack. A Ranged Attack is a type of Challenge Test, and the usual rules apply. During a Ranged Attack the use of Instant and Active Ki Feats, as well as Effects that can be used as Instants, is restricted. A model making a Ranged Attack may be referred to as “The Attacker”.
To make a Ranged Attack take a number of dice equal to the Attacker’s Ranged Pool Statistic, modified by any Instant Ki Feats, Ki Boosts, and Special Attacks. Determine the Challenge number based on Range and other relevant modifiers. Make a Challenge test as normal, followed by a Damage Roll based on the Success Level of the test.
If a Ranged Attack Targets a model in BtB with a Friendly model you will need to determine if you hit your Target or the Friendly model.

1.
  a) If the model is in BtB with an enemy model, the ranged attack fails, move to step 7. If the Model has multiple ranged Weapons, choose which one it will make the Ranged Attack with.
  b) Target a model.
  c) Measure the distance to the Enemy model and check this distance against the weapon’s Range Bands to see which Range the Ranged Attack is at. If the distance is further than the Long Range of the weapon the action fails, move to step 7.
  d) The player Controlling the Targeted model may at this point nominate a different Friendly model as the new Target if:
    i. Any line from the Attacker crosses through the nominated model’s ZoC before contacting the original Target’s Base.
    ii. The nominated model is able to draw LoS to the Activating model and is a valid target for the Ranged Attack.
    iii. The nominated model is not Exhausted or Insignificant.
    iv. If a model was nominated and the steps I, ii and iii were met, then the nominated model becomes the Targeted model. The new target cannot gain cover unless both the original target and the nominated model had cover from the attacker.
  e) Players declare the use of any Ki Feats, traits or Unique Effects by any model. The active player declares second.
Resolve any Ki Feats, traits or Unique Effects at the correct time, in case of conflict, resolve the active player’s effects first.
  f) Challenge Number of the Ranged Attack test is calculated based on the Range Band as well as any applicable modifiers.
  g) At this point, if the chosen Weapon has the Ammo trait, check if it has Ammo tokens; if not, this ranged attack ends - skip to step 7.
If the Weapon has the Reload trait, check if it has any Reload markers. If it does, this ranged attack ends - skip to step 7.
2. The Active Player then calculates the dice pool using the model’s Ranged pool Statistic as the base number of dice used, then decides if they will use any of its abilities, use a Ki feat or increase its Ranged pool Statistic through a Ki Boost.
  a) The Active Player then rolls their dice.
  b) The Active Player conducts any re-rolls of dice.
  c) The Active Player then selects the highest dice and up to two supporting dice, that did not roll a 1, will add +1 to the highest dice rolled. This gives the final result of the Ranged Attack test.
3. The player compares the final result against the Challenge Number. If the Attack is a success continue to Step 4 a) and 4 b). If the Attack has failed skip to Step 6.
4.
  a) The players declare the use of any Instant or Active Ki Feats (Active player declares last).
  b) If the target was in BtB with an enemy model, you must now check to see if you hit the correct target.
5. The Active Player then makes a Damage Roll against the Target model.
  a) Any model may use instant Ki feats at this step.
6. The model gains any Reload markers and removes Ammo Tokens (if applicable) from the weapon on the model’s profile card.
7. The Ranged Attack is now resolved.
  a) Any Boosts used for this attack expire.

### Determining the Ranged Attack Challenge Number

| Range Band | Challenge Number |
| --- | --- |
| Short | 4 |
| Medium | 5 |
| Long | 6 |

| Effect | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Target is Tiny | + 1 |
| Target is Small | + 0 |
| Target is Medium | - 1 |
| Target is Large | - 2 |
| Target is Huge | - 3 |
| Target is Prone | - 1 |
| Target is Surprised | - 1 |
| Target is in Cover | + 2 |
| Target Ran (this turn) | + 1 |
| Activating Model Ran (this turn) | + 1 |
| Activating Model Moved, or will Move, as part of this action | + 1 |
| Activating Model already made a Ranged Attack this turn. | + 1 |

Traits and Effects may also modify the roll.

Example: Model A has clear LoS to model B.
Model A has no LoS to model C because model G has a larger base size and blocks LoS.
Model A has LoS to model D, but since LoS passes through Obscuring terrain, model D has cover.
Model A’s LoS to model E would be completely blocked by the wall, but the wall is Tiny, so does not block LoS to the small based model E. Model E therefore has Cover.
The rock is Large, so completely blocks LoS from model A to model F.

Ranged Attack Example: The Active Player activates Tamotsu and declares a Ranged Attack Action.  The range is 9”, this is Medium Range for Tamotsu’s Bow and has base Challenge number of 5.
Checking modifiers, we add +1 to the Challenge number for moving and +1 because the Target is Tiny for a final Challenge number of 7.
Tamotsu has Ranged Pool 3.
Rolling a total of 8 (6+1+1=8) Tamotsu has a Success Level of 1.  Now make a Damage Roll on the Success Level 1 column.

### Targeting a model in BtB
If a model Targets an Enemy model in BtB with a Friendly model then at step 4b, make a Ranged Challenge test (6), with the following modifiers.
Target is Tiny +1
Target is Medium -1
Target is Large -2
Target is Huge Automatic Success

If the test is successful proceed as normal. If the test is a failure the Target of the Attack is changed to the nearest Friendly model in BtB with the original Target. The Ranged Attack continues with the new Target.

# Melee Exchanges
A Melee Attack is a type of Opposed test, and all the usual rules apply, during a Melee Attack the use of Instant and Active Ki Feats (And effects that can be used as Instants) is restricted. For a Melee Exchange, however, two tests are rolled simultaneously, with each model rolling Attack and Defence dice at the same time and applying traits to see which model comes out of the exchange victorious.

### Melee Exchanges
A Melee Exchange represents the awesome conflicts between the characters of Bushido using Katanas, Martial Arts, claws and teeth, Magical abilities and other stranger fighting techniques.


Example: Hiro is involved in a Melee Exchange, he has Melee Pool of 4 and spends 3 Ki to add another dice.
He now has 5 Dice in his Melee Pool and must split them into Attack and Defence. He can choose to put all 5 in Attack, 4 in Attack and 1 in Defence, 3 in Attack and 2 in Defence or any combination totalling 5 dice.

Melee exchanges usually occur as part of a Melee Action which allows you to move into BtB contact; often a melee action will be declared when already in BtB contact.
Once in BtB turn both models to face directly toward each other. Next players may declare any Instant Ki feats that will affect the melee, including Ki boosting the melee pool. The defender declares first.
Next players allocate dice pools. Secretly take your dice (You should have two colours of Dice, one for attack and one for Defence) and assign them, so you have a total equal to your melee pool.
You also need to remove dice from the Melee Pool to pay for any Special Attack or Defence.
Once both players have secretly allocated dice, reveal any special Attack or Defence and roll all the dice together.
In Bushido, dice with a value of 1 are removed from tests. Put them to one side they are not counted for the rest of the melee exchange.
The Active player’s model attacks first. Take the value of the highest attack dice rolled, and also up to two other attack dice to become a supporting dice which each add +1 to the highest value, to find the result of the attack.
The defender does the same with their defence dice, taking the highest and adding +1 for each supporting dice.
If the Attacker succeeds, the difference between the final results is the Success Level of the attack.
Any Special Attack or Defence is applied depending on the outcome.
This is used, along with a 2D6 Damage Roll on the damage table to find the total damage of the attack.
Assuming the defender is still around to make an attack, the defending player can now total his Attack Dice in the same way and check against the Attackers Defence to see if he also caused damage or uses a Special Attack or Defence.
Once the Melee Exchange is over, remove an Activation Counter from both models.

Example Melee Exchange
Masaema Aya is in BtB with Chiyo.  She activates and declares a Melee action.
Aya has Melee Pool 3 and wants to try to damage her opponent, she secretly allocates 2 dice to attack and only 1 to defence relying on her armour to protect her.
Neither player declares any Ki Feats. Chiyo declares Sidestep Defence, Aya does not use a Special.  
Masaema Aya rolls red dice for attack and a black dice with red pips for defence, while Chiyo rolls green dice for attack and a black dice with green pips for defence.
Both players then roll at the same time.
Aya has a total of 5 for her attack and Chiyo has 4 in defence.  Aya gets a Success Level 1 damage roll. 
Chiyo has a total of 6 in attack and Aya has 5 in defence, she also gets a Success Level 1 damage roll.

Note, this timing chart covers every eventuality of combinations of Abilities, Ki Feats, Special Attacks and Defences and all manner of other ‘in game’ occurrences. 
Use the following steps to resolve a Melee Exchange:

1. If the two models are in BtB, rotate both models so that their Facings are aligned with each other.  Otherwise Skip to Step 7a.
2. Choose which weapon will be used for the exchange, non-Activating model first. This will determine which Traits and Special attacks and defences are available.
3.
  a) Determine which model has the Initiative. The model with the Initiative is the Attacker the other model the Defender. By default, Activating models have the Initiative, but some traits and States may change this. In all the following steps, the player without the initiative declares any non-simultaneous effects first. Regardless of Initiative the Active Player and Activating Model do not change.
  b) Both players may now use Instant Ki Feats to change the initiative. The non-Activating player declares first. If the initiative was changed, the Activating player may then also declare Instant Ki Feats to change the initiative.
  c) The initiative is now set and cannot be changed.
4. Both players then calculate their model’s dice pool using its Melee Pool Statistic value as the base number of dice used and apply any modifiers. They then decide if they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or increase the Melee pool Statistic through a Ki Boost. The Player without the Initiative must declare everything before the Player with the Initiative.
5. Once the players have calculated their dice pools, they must both secretly decide how to allocate the dice between Attack and Defence. If players are using a Special Attack or Special Defence, then they must secretly remove a number of dice from their pool equal to the cost of the Special Attack or Defence (p.47).
Also include the use of any effects, including Instant (or Active for the active player) Ki Feats, which alter the cost of Attacks or Defences, or add additional Attacks or Defences.
The Dice allocation, choice of Special Ability, and any additional choices gained are Hidden Information until simultaneously revealed.
6. Once both players have allocated their dice:
  a) Declare the use of any effects used which alter the cost of Attacks or Defences or add additional Attacks or Defences (You will have secretly decided the use of these abilities in Step 5).
  b) Announce simultaneously if they are using a Special Attack or Defence.
  c) Remember a model can only use one Special Attack or Defence, not both types.
7.
  a) If the models are still in BtB both players roll all their dice simultaneously; otherwise, the melee action ends now, the Activating model removes an activation counter.
  b) Perform any re-rolls in the order given in Conducting Re-rolls (p.32), then remove or add dice last. See for example Unblockable, Impenetrable Defence traits.
8. Both players then calculate their final Attack and Defence results by selecting the highest dice of each type (Defence and Attack), each player then collects up to two dice rolled of each type (Attack & Defence) which were not 1’s. Each of these supporting dice will add +1 to the highest dice rolled. The players apply any modifiers from traits and effects to their highest dice rolled to get their model’s final Attack and Defence results.
  a) Remember, if a player rolls no dice of one type then their final result of that type is 0. If a player rolls no Attack dice, then no Damage Roll is made in Step 9.
9. If no dice are allocated to Attack, any Special Attacks do not trigger. 
If no dice are allocated to Defence, any Special Defences do not trigger. 
Any dice that are 1’s are not counted towards resolving the test but still count towards the player having allocated dice in the appropriate dice pool.
10. The Attacker compares its final Attack result against the Defender’s final Defence result, using Tiebreakers if necessary Note: when checking which player has the most dice for tiebreakers, count all attack and defence dice (That did not roll 1s) for both players towards tiebreakers for both attack and defence.
  a) If the Attacker was successful apply the effects of any Special Attacks used by the Attacker and move to Step 11.
  b) If the Defender was successful apply any Special Defences used by the Defender. If this results in either model being removed from the table, the defender no longer being in BtB with the Attacker, or the defender becoming Prone, skip to Step 14 otherwise move to Step 13.
11. The players declare the use of any Instant (or Active for the active player) Ki Feats for models involved in the Melee Exchange.
12. The Attacker makes a Damage Roll against the Defender and resolves any effects triggered by damage in melee. If at the end of this step either the Defender model is removed from the table, is no longer in BtB with the Attacker, or is Prone skip to Step 14.
13. Run through from Step 10 with the Defender becoming the Attacker unless it has already been the Attacker this Melee Exchange.
14. The Melee Exchange is now resolved, and both models remove one activation counter.
15. Any Boosts used for this Melee Exchange expire.

### Melee Pool Modifiers

| Effect | Dice Pool Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Model is Exhausted | -1 |
| Melee Assist | -1 per model Assisting |
| Model is Prone, Blind, Stunned, Frightened, Held. | -1 per State |
| Model ran this turn | -1 |
| Model is Surprised | -1 |
| Model declared a Stand Up action | -1 |

### Melee Assist
Models in Melee Exchanges suffer a -1 modifier for each Enemy model in BtB with which they are not currently resolving a Melee Exchange, and which is not also in BtB with a Friendly model. The enemy model is said to be Assisting the Melee.

# Wound Table
The Success Level indicates which column of the Wound Table the player should consult. The player then makes a Damage Roll using 2D6, adding together results along with any positive or negative modifiers, the result of which determines which row to use to find the number of wounds inflicted by the attack. 1’s are not failures when making a Damage Roll. If the final result would be less than 2, treat it as 2. If the final result would be higher than 12, treat it as 12.

Success Level
| 2D6 |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2  |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |
|  3  |   0 |   0 |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |
|  4  |   0 |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |
|  5  |   0 |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |
|  6  |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
|  7  |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
|  8  |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
|  9  |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |  11 |
|  10 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |  11 |
|  11 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |  11 |  12 |
|  12 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |

Example: Masaema Aya manages to hit Ito Itsunagi for a Success Level 3, Rolling 2D6 for damage she gets a 3 and 5, adding her Strength of +1 we see a total of 9. Cross-referencing the results on the wound table, we see that Itsunagi Ito suffers 4 wounds.

# Special Abilities
Melee exchanges in Bushido involve samurai sword masters and monks with mystical martial arts; they are not merely about hitting the opponent. A wide variety of different abilities can be used in a melee exchange.
If a model is able to attempt one of these Special Attacks or Defences, it will appear on the model’s profile card in the weapon grid. A model can only use a special attack or defence if it is using the weapon that has it on its grid. These special abilities allow a model to trigger a special effect if it uses the ability and successfully Attacks or Defends. 
All Special Attacks and Defences have a bracketed cost after the name text.
E.g. Sidestep Defence (1)
This is the number of dice to remove from the model’s Melee or Ranged Pool (as appropriate) if it chooses to use a Special Attack or Defence. A model’s dice pool cannot be reduced to 0 through the use of a Special Attack or Defence, and if this would happen the player cannot declare that Special Attack or Defence.
A model may only perform one Special Attack or Defence per Melee Exchange or Ranged Attack.
Some special Abilities can cause models to move when successful. All movement from Special Abilities ignore enemy model’s ZoC and being in BtB.
- If through a Special Attack or Defence a model would be moved past the edge of the game area then it stops when its base touches the edge of the board.
- If through a movement from a Slam Attack, Throw Attack or Throw Defence a model is moved into BtB with another model then, dependant on the two models’ Sizes, one of the following occurs:
- If the model contacted is of equal size, the moving model stops at the point at which it entered BtB, and both models become Prone.
- If the model contacted is of a larger Size, the moving model stops at the point at which it entered BtB and becomes Prone.
- If the model contacted is of a smaller Size, the moving model continues its movement and pushes the model it contacted directly away from the point of contact a distance that would enable the moving model to continue its movement without contacting the model. Both models become Prone at the end of the movement.
- If through a movement from a Push Attack, Forceback Attack, Drag Defence or Push Defence a model is moved into BtB with another model then the moving model stops at the point at which it entered BtB.
- If an Impassable Terrain element would prevent this movement, then the model must stop at the point of contact with the Terrain element. If this was due to a Slam Attack, Throw Attack or Throw Defence, the model also becomes prone.
Ranged attacks will never have Special Defences because there are no defence dice for a ranged attack. However, ranged weapons may have Special Attacks on their weapon grid. A model that gains a special ability by any means can only use that ability for melee weapons unless otherwise stated.


## Special Attacks
Combo Attack: If the Attack is successful then after resolving a Damage Roll, deduct 2 from the Success Level of the Attack. If the new Success Level is 0 or greater make another Damage Roll against the Defender. Repeat this process until the Success Level is less than 0. If the Success Level of the original attack was 0 or 1, after resolving a Damage Roll, make one additional Damage Roll against the Defender at Success Level 0.
Note: If a model has abilities that trigger when damage is caused each damage roll will trigger those abilities separately.

Critical Attack: If this model’s Attack is successful, and the individual dice results of the Damage Roll are the same number, remove the Defender from play.

Drag Attack: If the Attack is successful, move the Attacker 1” away from the Defender, then move the Defender 1” directly towards the Attacker. The Defender does not suffer a Damage Roll from this Attack.

Dual Attack: If the Attack is Successful, after rolling Damage, make one more Damage roll at the same success level.

Forceback Attack: If the Attack is successful, move the Defender 1” directly away from the Attacker, then move the Attacker 1” directly towards the Attacker. The Defender suffers half the Wounds from the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

Grapple Attack: If the attack is successful, the Defender becomes Held. Place a Held marker on the Defender. The Defender does not suffer a Damage roll from this Attack but may not attack during this Melee Exchange.

Powerful Attack: If the Attack is successful, then the Attacker gains +3 to the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

Push Attack: If the Attack is successful, move the Defender directly away from this model until it leaves this model’s ZoC. The Defender does not suffer a Damage Roll from this Attack.

Sidestep Attack: If the Attack is successful, the Attacker leaves BtB and then moves away from the Defender until The Attacker leaves the Defender’s ZoC, at which point its movement ends. The Defender does not suffer a Damage Roll from this Attack.

Slam Attack: If the Attack is successful, the Defender is moved 3” directly away from the Attacker and becomes Prone. The Defender suffers half the Wounds from the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

Stun Attack: If the attack is Successful, the Defender gains a Stunned Marker after the Damage Roll.

Sweep Attack: If the Attack is successful, then the Defender becomes Prone. The Defender suffers half the wounds from the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

Throw Attack:  If the Attack is successful, the Defender is moved 2” in a straight line and becomes Prone. The Defender suffers half the Wounds from the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

## Special Defences
Counterstrike Defence: If this Defence is successful, and the Attacker allocated any dice to Attack, then deduct 2 from the Success Level of the Defence. If the Success Level is 0 or greater, then make a Damage Roll against the Attacker using the modified Success Level of the Defence.

Drag Defence: If the Defence is successful, move the Defender 1” away from the Attacker, then move the Attacker directly into BtB with the Defender.

Forceback Defence: If the Defence is successful, move the Attacker 1” directly away from the Defender, then move the Defender directly into BtB with the Attacker.

Grapple Defence: If the Defence is successful, the Attacker becomes Held. Place a Held marker on the Attacker

Push Defence: If the Defence is successful, move the Attacker directly away from the Defender until it leaves the defender’s ZoC.

Sidestep Defence: If the Defence is successful, the Defender leaves BtB and then moves away from the Attacker until the Defender leaves the Attacker’s ZoC, at which point its movement ends.

Sweep Defence: If the Defence is successful, then the Attacker becomes Prone.

Throw Defence: If the Defence is successful, the Attacker is moved 2” in a straight line and becomes Prone.

## Exceptional Attacks and Defences
Some techniques are only known to a few Masters of the sword or fist. Exceptional attacks and defences are detailed on individual profile cards; a few examples are detailed below.

Eagle’s Flight Defence: If the Defence is successful this model may Move 3” after the Melee Exchange is resolvedIvory. 
Ivory Prison Attack: If this Attack is successful then remove the non-Insignificant, non-Soulless Target from play and deploy a Prone, non-unique Kairai under your control by replacing the target

Gokusatsu Attack: If this attack is Successful, remove the defender and attacker from play. If the enemy model has this Exceptional Attack, then this attack has no effect on either combatant.

Web Defence: If this model successfully Defends, the Enemy model may not move until the current activation has ended.

Forceback Attack
Akio (blue) is the attacking model. 
The defender is moved 1” directly away from the attacker.
The attacker is then moved directly forward into BtB with the defender.
After the Damage roll, the Damage is halved (rounding down).

Push Attack
Akio (blue) is the attacking model. 
The defender is moved directly away from the attacker until they leave the attacker’s Zone of Control.
No damage roll is made.

Sidestep Attack
Akio (blue) is the attacking model. 
The attacker may move away from the defender any distance until it leaves the defender’s Zone of Control.
No damage roll is made.

Slam Attack
Akio (blue) is the attacking model. 
The Defender is moved 3” directly away from the Attacker and gains a Prone marker.
After the damage roll, the damage is halved (rounding down).

Throw Attack
Akio (blue) is the Attacking model. 
The Defender is moved 2” away from the Attacker to a point in LoS of the Attacker. 
The Attacker may choose the movement path.
After the Damage Roll, the damage is halved (rounding down).

# Model States
A model may enter into a number of different States during a game. A model may be in more than one State at a time. Markers should be placed on a model, or its profile card to indicate a model’s State to the Opponent.

Berserk: While a model has a Berserk marker, it gains the Aggressive trait. When a model gains a Berserk marker, it gains an Impetuous marker.
When a Berserk model activates check the following steps in order until one applies:
If in range, this model must select the nearest valid Enemy model and declare a Melee Action.
If in range and this model has two Activation counters, this model must declare a Charge Action and Target the nearest valid Enemy model.
This model turns to directly face the nearest Enemy model and must declare a Run action directly towards that model, running the maximum distance possible.
If the model is unable to Target or Select an Enemy and unable to declare a Run Action, it may instead perform any action.
During the End Phase remove all Berserk markers in play.

Bleed: If a model has Bleed markers it is considered to be Bleeding. During the End Phase remove the highest value Bleed marker; the model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed Bleed marker’s value. After this, if the model still has three or more Bleed markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 markers.
If a Bleeding model Heals any of its marked wounds from its wound track by any means, remove all Bleed markers from it.

Blind: If a model has a Blind marker it cannot draw LoS outside of BtB and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier during Melee exchanges. Blind models may not declare Run or Charge Actions. During the End, Phase remove all Blind markers from each model with any Blind markers. Models with Sixth Sense automatically have Immune [Blind].

Controlled: A Controlled model switches Warbands for a number of actions dependant on the number of Control markers it has.
Whilst Controlled the model generates Ki Tokens normally, but cannot spend or remove any Tokens it possesses, Ki or otherwise. The controlling player may declare any action the model would normally be able to perform without spending Tokens.
For each Activation Counter removed from the model (or if a model participates in a Melee Exchange without removing an Activation Counter); also remove a Control marker. If a model has only one Control Marker, it cannot declare Complex Actions. As soon as all the Control Markers are removed, the model returns to the original player’s Warband. While Controlled, if an effect applies further Control Markers, instead remove one marker for each Control marker the effect would add.

Death Sentence: While a model with any Death Sentence markers is the target of a Ranged Attack or is involved in a Melee Exchange, the Enemy model gains +1 Melee Pool or +1 Ranged Pool as well as +1 to any Damage Rolls. The benefit for the Attacker is the same whether the target has one or multiple Death Sentence markers. During the Starting Phase, a model with a Death Sentence marker may spend 3 Ki to remove one Death Sentence marker from itself.

Diseased: If a model has Disease markers then during the Starting Phase remove a Disease marker and an Activation counter.

Disguised: While a model has a Disguised (X) marker, Enemy models with a Ki Statistic of 1 or less cannot Target or voluntarily move into BtB with the Disguised model.
If the enemy model has a Ki Statistic of 2 or greater, when making a Ranged Attack or Ki Feat against a Disguised model, once the attack or Feat has been determined to be in range, the Enemy model must make a Challenge (X) Ki test where X is the highest value of Disguise Marker on the Target model.
When attempting to move into BtB, determine if the model has enough movement to reach BtB and if so, make a Challenge (X) Ki test.
If the Enemy model is successful remove the Disguise marker and resolve the action as normal. If unsuccessful its activation ends before any movement, and it removes an activation counter as if it had completed the attempted action.
If a Disguised model declares a Melee, Ranged, Charge or Scenario action; uses the Bodyguard trait; or participates in a Melee Exchange; remove its Disguise marker. While a model is Disguised enemy models may ignore its ZoC.

Frightened: This model gains the Defensive trait and suffers a -1 Melee Pool and Ranged Pool modifier. It may not declare actions that would move it into BtB with Enemy models with the Fear trait. During the Main Phase, Frightened models automatically fail Fear tests. During the End Phase, the model must take another Fear test with the same Challenge Number as it failed when entering the Frightened State. If successful or if no Fear Test was failed, remove all Frightened markers.

Held: As long as a model is Held it gains the Defensive trait and cannot declare any actions except Disengage, Ki Feats usable in Melee or Stand Up. A Held model cannot move or be moved, except to change facing, and suffers a -1 Melee Pool. Remove the model’s Held marker when:
· The Holding model is no longer in BtB with the Held model.

· The Holding model participates in a Melee exchange with another model.

· Or the Held model has successfully Disengaged from the Holding model.
A Model with the Intangible or Agile trait has Immune [Held].
Immobilised: When an Immobilised model declares a Melee, Run, Charge, Scenario, Stand Up, Heal, or any action including movement (Including changing facing; before the action, the model must make a Size (6) Challenge test.
If unsuccessful the model’s action is considered resolved. If successful the model removes all Immobilised markers and resolves its action as normal.
An Immobilised model cannot declare the use of Special attacks or Defences. A model can declare a Wait action to remove all Immobilised markers. Enemy models in BtB with an Immobilised model can declare actions as if they were not in BtB.

If any other effect moves an Immobilised model, then remove all Immobilised markers from it.
Intangible models have Immune [Immobilised].

Impetuous: As long as any model in a Warband has an impetuous marker and any Activation Counters no models without an impetuous marker may activate. Remove one impetuous marker when the model performs an action consuming any number of activation counters.

On Fire: If a model has Fire markers it is considered to be On Fire. During the End Phase remove the highest value Fire marker, the model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed Fire marker’s value. These wounds ignore the Tough trait. After this, if the model still has three or more Fire markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 markers.
A model with Fire markers on its profile card, or a Friendly model in BtB, may take a Wait action to remove two Fire markers from the model.

Poisoned: If a model has Poison markers, it is considered Poisoned. During the End Phase remove the highest value Poison marker, the model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed Poison marker’s value. After this, if the model still has three or more Poison markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 markers.

Prone: If a model is Prone it suffers a -1 Melee Pool penalty and does not block LoS.
Enemy models may ignore it’s ZoC and may choose not to be considered in BtB with them when declaring or performing their actions, meaning the action choice is not restricted by being in BtB with the Prone model.
Prone models are always the Attacker second in Melee Exchanges and may not use Special Abilities or benefit from traits or effects that affect Initiative. 
The only action a Prone model may declare is Stand Up.
If a Prone model initiates a Melee Exchange through taking a Stand Up action, it suffers -1 Melee Pool modifier for that Melee Exchange, but Initiative is not affected.
A prone model cannot gain Prone Markers.

Reloading: While a model has Reload Markers, it may not use any weapon with the reload trait to make Ranged Attacks. A model may perform a Wait Action to remove 1 Reload Marker.

Spirit Block: If a Model has a Spirit Block marker it does not generate Ki Tokens during the Ki Generation step. At the end of the Ki Generation Step remove one Spirit Block marker from each model with a Spirit Block marker.

Stunned: If a model has a Stunned Marker, it suffers a -1 Melee Pool and -1 Ranged Pool modifier. During the End Phase remove one Stunned marker from each model with a Stunned marker. An affected model may take a Wait Action to remove all Stunned Markers.

# Ki Feats
Each model may perform the Ki Feats on its profile card. Ki Feats are categorised in a number of ways; these explain any restrictions on a Ki Feat’s use, the timing of its use, its type and cost in Ki Tokens to use.
All Feats have a cost in Ki tokens; this cost must be spent for the effects of the Ki Feat to be applied. If a model does not have enough Ki tokens, then it may not declare the use of the Ki Feat. The cost of a Ki Feat or Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki token by modifiers, but effects can make feats cost zero if they explicitly state they do. The cost of a Ki Feat can be expressed with either a fixed cost or a variable cost.
 Not in Base to Base: All Ki Feats may be used while the model is in Base to Base contact with an enemy model unless it has this Icon.
 No Movement: Models performing Simple and Complex Ki Feat actions can Walk up to their Move stat in inches either before or after the Ki Feat is resolved unless it has this icon.
 Once per turn:
This model may only use this feat once per turn. When the feat is used mark the checkbox on the profile card. Erase the checkbox in the end phase.
 Once per game:
This model may only use this feat once per game. When the feat is used mark the checkbox on the profile card.
When a Ki Feat can be used depends on its timing. Instant and Active Ki Feats are not considered actions.
 Instant:
· Can be used at any time, except during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks - where the timing is restricted as detailed under the Melee Exchanges (p.40) and Ranged Attacks (p.36) sections.
· Because this is not an action, it can be combined with a Simple or Complex action if the model is the Activating model.
 Active:
· Can only be used at any time when this model’s Controller is the Active Player, even if it is not the Activating Model except during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks - where the timing is restricted as detailed under the Melee Exchanges (p.40) and Ranged Attacks (p.36) sections.
· Because this is not an action, it can be combined with a Simple or Complex action if the model is the Activating model or can be used when another model is activating.
Other than during a melee exchange or ranged attack, if both players wish to use Instant or Active Ki feats the active player goes first.
Any traits or effects that would impact the result of a dice roll, test or move must be declared, and any cost paid before the dice are rolled. Instant and Active Ki Feats as well as Ki Boosts, cannot be used to affect dice that have already been rolled. However, Ki Feats that grant re-rolls may be used after seeing the initial dice values.
 Simple:
· To use a Simple Ki Feat requires the model to declare a Simple Ki Feat action.
· Simple Ki Feats can only be used when the model is Activating.
 Complex:
· To use a Complex Ki Feat requires the model to declare a Complex Ki Feat action.
· Complex Ki Feats can only be used when the model is Activating.

Ki Feats are further classified by whom they affect:
 Personal: The Ki Feat targets the user only.
 Target (X”): The Ki Feat affects a specific Target model. The Target must be within X” otherwise the Ki Feat fails and the Ki Tokens paid for the Ki Feat are lost.
 Aura: The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable. The area the Aura covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Aura’s area are affected. The model from which the Aura originates is always considered within the Aura. Auras last until the End Phase or until the originating model is removed from play if this is before the End Phase.
 Pulse: The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable. The area the Pulse covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Pulse’s area are affected. The model from which the Pulse originates is always considered within the Pulse. A Pulse has no duration and ends as soon as the feat’s effect has been resolved.
 Special: The Ki Feat is unique in some way and is further described on the model’s profile card.
 Opposed Ki feat: Feats with this icon require an opposed Ki test with the target. If the test is successful, the feat takes effect.

### Ki Boosts to Statistics
Some models can increase a Statistic through the spending of Ki Tokens in the Main Phase. These increases are Ki Feats that are Instant  and Personal .
The cost of a Ki Feat or Ki Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki Token by standard modifiers, but the cost can be reduced to zero if an effect states explicitly it reduces the cost to zero. 
The increase to the Statistic lasts until the current test or movement is resolved. Each Ki Boost is considered a separate Ki Feat.

Example: Sakura targets Kenko with her Psychic Venom Ki Feat. As she began her activation in his back arc, and Kenko never had LoS to her, Kenko is surprised and cannot use his Ki Statistic Boost to defend himself.

# Traits
Models in Bushido commonly have one or more traits. Some traits have X, Y or Descriptor values in brackets after the trait’s name. This value can be a positive or negative modifier, a range or a Descriptor the trait affects. A Descriptor can be almost anything, from a profile name, Model type, a trait, a kind of Test or a state. When text exactly matches a Descriptor, it is considered a valid condition for game effects.
If a trait is listed on a card without an X or Y value, then it is assumed to be 1 or 1”. Note that values can be negative numbers. Other Traits have restrictions, and those traits only apply when the restrictions are met.  If a trait has more than one Descriptor separated by a comma, it affects all models of either Descriptor.  If a trait has more than one Descriptor including an & symbol then a model must have all listed traits to be affected.

E.g. Believer [Descriptor](X/Y”): Friendly models within Y” of Descriptor reduce the cost of their Ki Feats by X. This trait modifies the cost by the X value. Its Range is the Y” value, and it only affects [Descriptor] Models. Ashinaga Tenaga has the Believer [Villager](1/4”) trait. Villagers within 4” reduce the cost of their Ki Feats by 1. 
E.g. Strong [Melee] only applies the strong trait to Melee Damage rolls. Any other damage rolls made are unaffected.
E.g.  Leadership [Ashigaru, Samurai](1/8“) will affect all “Ashigaru” and all “Samurai” within 8” but Requirement [Loyal & Samurai] on an Enhancement card means the card can only be attached to a model with both “Loyal” and “Samurai” keywords.”


Some traits can be listed as a trait on the model or a weapon trait; these will be correctly shown on the card. If a trait is listed with a weapon on the card, it is treated as a weapon trait and only applies when choosing that weapon.
Players cannot choose whether they use traits but can choose in which order their own model’s traits trigger. Unless stated in their description, traits are always considered to be in effect.
Certain game effects can give a model a new trait. In some cases, where the trait has no numerical values the model gains the trait as stated; however, this is not cumulative with any existing trait. Effects which grant a Trait (X) do not stack, instead choose only the highest value.
Some effects may modify a trait’s value. If the model already has the trait, apply the modifier to the numerical value of the trait. If the model does not have the specified trait, it first gains the trait at value 0 and then applies the modifier to the newly added trait. Effects which grant a Trait (+X) stack, you add all these values together. Range values can also be modified in the same way. If a trait has a negative X value, this is always a modifier, not a fixed value. These stack, just like +X values.

Example: Kuma has Armour (1). If he gains Armour (2) from a nearby  Kami of Eternal Earth then he will use the new trait, they are not cumulative. Kuma now has Armour (2)
Example:  The Nightmares of Jigoku theme inflicts Spirit (-1).  This gives -1 to any Spirit value. If the target does not already have Spirit it gains Spirit (0) then the -1 modifier, to give it Spirit (-1).

Example: Naoko of the Ito Clan does not have the Armour trait, but uses Mutation to gain Armour (+1). She first gains Armour (0) and then applies the +1 modifier, giving her Armour (1). If a model had Armour (1) already and gained Armour (+1), it would now have Armour (2).

### A
Adept [Descriptor](X): When rolling [Descriptor] Tests this model may keep up to X additional supporting dice, beyond the normal 2. These also add +1 to the highest dice value when calculating the final result.

Aggressive: This model must allocate at least as many dice to Attack as to Defence during Melee Exchanges. If a model has both Aggressive and Defensive traits, the effects of both are cancelled.

Agile: When this model activates it may ignore Enemy models in BtB when declaring its action. This model may move out of BtB with Enemy models without the need to perform a Disengage action. If this model does not declare a Disengage action, Stand Up action, melee useable Ki Feat, or Melee action, it must move out of BtB with any Enemy models currently in BtB.
This model also has Immune [Held].

Aloof: This model may not perform Scenario Actions.

Ammo (X): This model starts the game with X Ammo tokens. When this model resolves a Ranged Attack, remove an Ammo Token. If this model has no Ammo tokens, it may not make Ranged Attacks with this weapon.

Armour (X): Reduce the result of Damage Rolls made against this model by X.
Assassin: If either:
this model did not begin its activation in BtB with an Enemy model, performs an action that Targets or brings it into BtB with that Enemy model, starts outside of LoS of that Enemy model and remains outside of its LoS during movement or
the Enemy model is Surprised
this model may roll three dice for any Damage Rolls caused by any Attack and choose two to add together, ignoring Weak and Strong Traits.

Aware: This model’s LoS extends 360 degrees around its base.

### B
Banzai!: This model may make a Charge Action as a Standard Simple action, rather than a Complex action.

Bear Stands Alone: While no friendly models are within 3” of this model it gains Indomitable (+1).

Believer [Descriptor](X/Y”): Friendly [Descriptor] models within Y” of this model reduce the cost of their Ki Feats by X. X cannot be less than 0.

Bleed(X/Y): Each time this model inflicts wounds through a Melee Exchange or Ranged Attack to a Non-Soulless Enemy model, that model gains X number of Bleed markers with value Y. If a model has multiple sources of bleed traits, it may only use one at any given time.

Blood of Orochi (X): This model generates X Blood of Orochi Tokens. During the Starting Phase place all Blood of Orochi tokens generated by Friendly models in a pool.
Choose any number of Friendly Ito Clan models. Each model chosen may gain up to 2 Blood of Orochi tokens taken from this pool.
The Weapons of models with Blood of Orochi tokens gain Poison (1/Y) where Y is the number of Blood of Orochi tokens taken by that model.
Remove all Blood of Orochi tokens in the End Phase.

Bodyguard [Descriptor] (X”): If an Enemy model declares an action that would move it into BtB with a [Descriptor] Friendly model, or Targets the [Descriptor] Friendly model with a Ranged Attack, this model may switch positions with the Friendly model before the action begins if the following conditions are met:

- The Friendly model is within X” and in LoS.
- The Friendly model was not in BtB with an Enemy model at the start of the activation.
- This model is not in BtB with an Enemy model.
- This model is not Exhausted or Prone.
- If the Enemy model has Fear, the bodyguard must pass a fear test.
- Both models switching positions can fit within the space the other model occupied on the table without moving any other models.
- If bodyguarding a larger based model, your opponent places the bodyguard anywhere within the area covered by the larger base then you choose facing.
The Enemy model’s action is then resolved with this model being declared as the Target. 
If this model has the Fear trait, the enemy model must make a Fear Test as if this model were its original target. 
Once the use of the Bodyguard trait by this model is declared, if this model has a Disguised Marker, remove the Disguised Marker immediately.

Example: Model A has the Bodyguard Trait. Model B declares a Ranged Attack Action. 
If the Target is model C then model A can use Bodyguard.
If the Target is model D then it cannot use Bodyguard as model A has no LoS to model D since it is not in its Facing.
Model E is not in Bodyguard range.
If the Target is model F it cannot use Bodyguard as model F is in BtB with model G.

Booted: When this model is deployed using Flank, it may immediately make a Walk.

Bravery: This model may re-roll a failed Fear Test. It may only re-roll the same Fear Test once due to this trait. If a model with Bravery gains the Cowardly trait, it is considered to have neither trait. If a model with the Bravery trait makes a Fear test against a model with the Terror trait, the effects of both are cancelled.

Brutal (X): In a Melee Exchange this model adds X to the result when calculating its final Attack result. This model adds X to the result when calculating its final Ranged 
Attack result.

### C
Camouflage (X”): While this model is benefiting from Cover, Enemy models cannot Target or enter BtB with this model outside of their activation unless they are within X”.
At the start of an Enemy model’s activation, if this model is benefiting from Cover, that Enemy model cannot Target or enter BtB with this model unless the Enemy model is within X” of this model at the start of the Enemy model’s activation.

Example: Model A Camouflage (2”).
Model B starts more than 2” away from model A, and so cannot Target model A, even if it moves within 2” of it.
Model C is within 2” so can Target model A.
Model D is more than 2” from model A but model A has no Cover from model D so model D can Target model A.

Cavalry(X”): Before or after this model performs any action it may Walk X”.

Channel (X/Y”): Once per turn, during this model’s activation it may remove up to X Ki tokens from its profile card. Its Controller then distributes those Ki tokens to any other Friendly model(s) within Y”.

Chain Weapon (X): When using this weapon, models involved in a melee exchange with this model reduce their Parry trait by X to a minimum of 0 and lose any Shield rule.

Charging Bonus [Bonus]: When this model makes a Charge action it gains the bracketed Bonus until the end of its current activation. If the bonus is a Weapon Trait, then it applies to all valid weapons. This trait may also be a weapon trait if so the bonus only applies when choosing this weapon.

Cloudwalk: When this model moves it ignores Terrain elements, other models, and Zones of Control. It may end its move in an enemy ZoC. This does not allow a model to move out of Melee unless it also has the Agile trait.  This model may not end its move occupying the same area as an Impassable Terrain element or another model.

Command [Descriptor](X/Y”): This model may declare a Simple action, Command Action   : The model nominates and activates up to X other non-Exhausted, Friendly [Descriptor] models within Y inches. These models each perform a Standard, Simple action. The order the models activate in is chosen by this model’s Controller after each action is resolved remove an activation counter from the activating model. If a model with the Group trait is chosen you must choose all models on that profile card; if you cannot, then you cannot command any of those models.

Construct: This model provides cover as if it were terrain.

Co-ordinated Attack [Descriptor]: If this model is in a Melee Exchange and one or more Friendly [Descriptor] models is also in BtB with the Enemy model, this model gains +1 Melee Pool bonus.

Cowardly: This model must re-roll successful Fear tests. It must only re-roll the same Fear test once due to this trait. If a model with Cowardly gains the Bravery trait it is considered to have neither trait.

Courage (X): When making a Fear Test, modify the result by X.

Cultist (X/Y”): When this model activates it may inflict up to X Wounds on any Friendly model(s) within Y”, including itself, that have this trait, up to X value. A model may not suffer more Wounds than it has unmarked Wound boxes. This model gains Ki Tokens equal to the number of Wounds inflicted. A model cannot suffer more Wounds from this trait than the X value of its own Cultist trait each turn. These Wounds ignore Tough.

### D
Defensive: This model must allocate at least as many dice to Defence as to Attack during Melee Exchanges. If a model has both Aggressive and Defensive traits, the effects of both are cancelled.

Disguise (X): This model begins the game with a Disguise (X) marker.

Disease (X): Models damaged by this model gain X Disease markers.

Disturb Flow (X/Y”): All Enemy models must spend an additional X Ki Tokens to perform Ki Feats when within Y” of this model. If in range of multiple enemy models with this trait only use the highest X value.

Dodge (X): During a Melee Exchange this model may pick up to X Attack dice rolled by its Opponent to be re-rolled. The same dice may only be re-rolled once due to this model’s trait.

Dread (X): Models making a fear test against this model reduce their Ki statistic by X. This cannot reduce the number of dice rolled below 1 dice. Enemy models with Fear values equal to or higher than this model’s fear value do not automatically pass their fear tests against this model.

Durable: When this model would suffer more than one wound, it only suffers one wound. This trait is resolved after the Tough trait.

### E
Endurance: This model suffers no Melee penalty for being Exhausted.

Entangling: Successful attacks with this weapon do no damage but cause the target to be Immobilised.

Evasive: This model ignores Enemy models’ Zones of Control during its movement.

### F
Fear (X): When a model makes a Fear test against this model X is the Challenge Number for the test. Models automatically pass Fear tests with a Challenge Number equal to or lower than their Fear (X) trait, but must still take a Fear test if the Challenge Number is higher than their Fear (X) trait.

Fearless: This model automatically succeeds when taking Fear tests and has Immune [Frightened].

Feint (X): During Melee Exchanges this model may pick up to X Defence dice rolled by its Opponent to be re-rolled. The same dice may only be re-rolled once due to this model’s trait.

Fire (X/Y): Each time this model inflicts wounds using this weapon, the Enemy model gains X Fire Y markers. If a model has multiple sources of fire traits, it may only use one at any given time.

Flank: When this model would be Deployed, this model’s Controller must choose whether this model will use Flank or not. If the player chooses not to use Flank, this model is Deployed as normal. 
If the player decides the model is using Flank, then the model is left Elsewhere and instead before the game the owning player makes a note of which turn the Flanking models will arrive and notes a neutral table edge: This is Hidden Information. This must be turn 2,3 or 4. In the starting phase of that turn reveal the number and deploy the models anywhere along the chosen edge but not in the Opponent’s Deployment Zone. 
If a model gains Flank mid game or is removed and returns to play using the flank rules, you immediately note any turn after the current turn (not just 2,3 or 4) and a neutral edge for that model when it is removed from play. This is Hidden Information. Flanking models generate two Activation Counters when they are Deployed.
Fortune: During Ki Generation, this model’s controller may flip a coin and call heads or tails. If they call successfully, double the number of Ki tokens gained; if not this model gains no Ki tokens instead.

### G
Group: All models represented by this profile card activate in the same single activation. Each model on this profile card resolves any movement before any Melee Exchanges are resolved. Melee Exchanges are then resolved in the order the Controlling player chooses.

### H
Hatred [Descriptor]: This Model cannot be included in a Warband that includes [Descriptor] models.

Heal (X): This model may declare a Simple Heal action and attempt to enter BtB with another non-soulless model by moving up to its Move Statistic. If, at the end of its movement, it is in BtB with the chosen model Heal X marked wounds from the Wound Track of the chosen model. This model may choose to heal itself. It may not move if it does so. X cannot be less than 0.

Huge: This model is the Huge Size. Model’s Targeting this model with a Ranged Attack gain a -3 modifier to the Challenge Number of the test.

### I
Immune [Descriptor]: This model may not gain markers of [Descriptor]. If a model gains the Immune trait, immediately remove all markers of [Descriptor].

Immovable: This model may not be moved or placed except when making a Disengage, Melee, Run, Walk or Charge or by using a rule on a friendly card. This model cannot gain Prone Markers. This model does not rotate at the start of a Melee Exchange, or when performing a Scenario Action.

Impenetrable Defence: During this model’s Melee Exchanges the Enemy model must remove its highest Attack dice rolled before the final Attack result is calculated.

Impetuous(X): If this model is on the Battlefield during the Starting Phase, this model gains X Impetuous Markers. While this model has Impetuous Markers, it has the Fearless trait.

Indomitable (X): This model ignores X assisting Enemy models in BtB for penalties during Melee Exchanges.

Insignificant: This model:
- Has a ZoC that may be ignored at all times.
- Cannot apply Melee assist Modifiers.
- May not perform Simple Scenario or Complex Scenario actions.

Intangible: This model ignores Zones of Control, other models and Terrain elements during movement and being in BtB when declaring actions; it may move out of BtB freely. It may not end its move occupying the same area as an Impassable Terrain element or another model. This model also has Immune [Held, Immobilised].

Intimidate: During the Starting Phase, this model can Target an enemy model within 8”, Perform an Opposed Ki test with the Targeted model, if this model is successful the Target gains Cowardly, loses Aggressive and cannot Choose or Target this model with a Melee, Charge or Ranged Attack until the End Phase.

### J
Jump Up: At the start of this model’s activation, but before its action is declared, you may remove any Prone markers from this model.

### K
Kami: When this model is deployed it gains Ki tokens equal to its maximum Ki. When this model would suffer wounds, instead remove an equal number of Ki tokens. For effects that would cause Wounds to be marked on a model, a Kami treats its Ki Tokens as if they were unmarked Wound Boxes. For each Ki below its maximum it is considered to have one marked Wound Box. If this model has no Ki tokens, it is Killed then Removed from Play.
This model may not gain Ki tokens as a result of the Channel trait. This Model cannot have Ki tokens removed as a result of the Leech trait. This model has Immune (Poisoned/On Fire/Bleed/Diseased) and cannot be Healed. A Kami model may not use a Ki Feat if spending the Ki Tokens would cause it to lose all its remaining Ki Tokens.

Kata: When rolling for a melee exchange, this model can use natural 1s on its dice to resolve the test as a value of 1 rather than 0. The dice are not removed and can be used as supporting dice to find the final result and remain for tiebreakers.

Ki Block: When this model inflicts wounds with this weapon the Enemy model gains one Spirit Block marker.

### L
Last Stand: If this model is reduced to 0 wounds, it may still be activated until the end of the Turn and is not removed from play. This model cannot recover wounds through any game effects or traits once its wounds have been reduced to 0. During the End Phase, the model is removed from play.
Leadership [Descriptor](X/Y”): Whilst within Y” Friendly [Descriptor] models add X to the final Result when taking 
a Fear Test. If in range of multiple models with Leadership, use only the highest X value.

Leech (X/Y”): Once per turn, during this model’s activation, it may remove up to X Ki Tokens from profile card(s) of any other Friendly models within Y” and add them to its own.

Lightweight: This model does not suffer the modifier for moving during a Ranged Attack when using this weapon.

Lightfooted: While moving, this model treats Difficult Terrain elements as if they were Normal. If a model with this trait gains the Unstable Trait, it counts as having neither trait.

Lightning Reflexes: This model is always the first Attacker in Melee Exchanges. Models with this trait gain the initiative against models with Reach weapons. If both models in a Melee Exchange have this trait, then neither gains the benefit.

### M
Mantra: While making an opposed Ki test, this model can use natural 1s on its dice to resolve the test as a value of 1 rather than zero. The dice are not removed and can each be used as a supporting dice to find the final result and remain for tiebreakers.

Mettle (X): When this model is not the Activating model in an opposed Ki test, the attacker must discard its X highest dice rolled before the final result is calculated.

### O
Oni Rage: While this model has a Berserk Marker it gains Tough (+1). In the Starting Phase, if this model is on the Battlefield, it may gain a Berserk Marker. If it does so, it gains 2 Ki Tokens.

Order [Descriptor](X/Y”): This model may declare a Complex action, Order Action   : This model immediately nominates X other Friendly [Descriptor] models within Y”. Those models’ gain one Activation Counter. Models may only be affected by the Order Action once per Turn.

### P
Pack (X/Y”): When this model activates, you may choose up to X non-exhausted friendly models with the Pack trait within Y” to also activate. This model and each model chosen must declare a melee, ranged or charge action against the same target. Each model resolves any movement before any Melee Exchanges are resolved. 
Melee Exchanges are then resolved in the 
order the Controlling player chooses.

Parry (X): This model adds X to the Defence result when calculating its final Defence result in Melee Exchanges.

Pierce (X): When this model succeeds with an Attack using this weapon, reduce the Enemy model’s Armour trait by X to a minimum of 0.

Poison (X/Y): Each time this model inflicts wounds through a Melee Exchange or Ranged Attack with this weapon on a non-soulless model, the Enemy model gains X Poison Y markers. If a model has multiple sources of poison traits, it may only use one at any given time.

Protected[Descriptor](X”): Before this model suffers a damage roll as a result of a successful melee or ranged attack you can remove a friendly [Descriptor] model within X” from play and suffer no damage roll.

Prowess [Descriptor](X): During a [Descriptor] Test this model may re-roll up to X of its own dice. It may only re-roll dice once due to this trait.
The Descriptors [Attack] and [Defence] refer to Melee Exchanges but are further limited.

### R
Ranged Defence (X): A model making a Ranged Attack against this model modifies the Challenge Number of the test by X.

Rapid Fire (X): When this model declares a Ranged Attack action it may resolve up to X Ranged Attacks during the activation. These Ranged Attacks may Target different models and are resolved in the order this model’s Controller chooses. Each attack may use a different weapon. Remove only one activation counter regardless of the number of Ranged Attacks made by Rapid Fire.

Reach: While using this weapon, it grants this model the Initiative at Step 3 of a Melee Exchange, provided it was not in BtB with its opponent or another Enemy model at the start 
of the current Activation.If both models in a Melee Exchange would benefit from this Trait, then neither benefits from it.

Regenerate (X): This model Heals X wounds during the End Phase.

Reload (X): When this model makes a Ranged Attack with this weapon it gains X Reload Markers.

Resistance (X): This model modifies the result by X when it participates in an Opposed Ki test and is not the Activating model.

Rise (X): When this model is reduced to 0 wounds, immediately make a Challenge test with a Challenge Number of X. If successful the model Heals all Wounds and becomes Prone. If it fails remove the model from play as normal. Models may not use this trait if their final wounds were caused by the Fire state in the end phase.

### S
Scout (X/Y”): This model may deploy after both player’s normal Deployment and may deploy anywhere within Y” of the Controlling player’s normal Deployment Zone. If a Warband contains one or more models with Scout, the player adds the highest X value to the result of Deployment Tactical Tests. If both players have models with Scout the loser of the Deployment Tactical Test deploys their models with Scout first.

Sacrifice [Descriptor](X”): If this model is not Exhausted or in BtB with an Enemy model, and a Friendly [Descriptor] model is within X” and has been successfully Attacked, its Controller may choose to remove this model from play to cancel the Damage Roll against the Friendly model.

Sharp(X): This model reduces the enemy model’s Tough trait by X, to a minimum of 0, when it succeeds with an Attack with this weapon.

Sixth Sense: This model is never Surprised, ignores the Camouflage trait and has Immune [Blind].

Slow: This model may not declare Run or Charge actions. During a melee exchange, this model will lose the initiative if it is the active model. If this model has Lightning Reflexes, a weapon with the Reach trait or both then it ignores those traits and Slow for the duration of the melee exchange.

Soulless: This model automatically succeeds at Fear tests and has Immune [Bleed, Frightened, Poison]. This model also automatically succeeds at Opposed Ki Tests when it is not the Active mode.

Spirit (X): This model modifies its Ki Statistic by X when resolving Ki tests or when attempting to Target or move into BtB with a Disguised model. Apply this before gaining any dice for having zero or lower Ki Statistic in any test. This model’s Ki Statistic may exceed double the base Statistic by X, models with Ki Statistic 0 may Ki Boost to 1 and then add X.

Split Attack: When this model declares a Melee or Charge action it may move into BtB with 2 or more enemy models and ignores their ZoC as long as it is moving closer to a point where it is in BtB with both. After its movement, if it is in BtB with two or more Enemy models, the player may resolve a Melee Exchange with two or more of those models. This model has a penalty of -1 dice for each additional melee exchange it will make this activation on all its melee exchanges. Resolve them in the order the Controlling player chooses (so that the model will be left facing the enemy model it fought last).
Remove Activation Counter(s) from this model only after the last Melee Exchange.

Steadfast: This model may freely choose how to allocate dice in Melee Exchanges when Frightened. If this model declares an action to bring it BtB with a model with Fear and fails the fear test, it must continue with the action and becomes Frightened. While Frightened this model may still declare actions against and enter BtB with models with Fear.

Example: Kenko has Split Attack. If he moves into melee with 2 models and performs a melee exchange against both, he takes a -1 dice penalty on both exchanges as he is making one additional exchange. Next turn a third enemy model moves into BtB with Kenko. If Kenko makes a split attack against all three models, he will take a -2 Dice penalty on all three melee exchanges.

Strategy [Bonus]: Whenever you win the Tactical Roll, this model gains the bracketed bonus.

Strong: This model makes Size tests at +1 Dice. When this model makes a Damage Roll, roll 3D6 and choose the two highest dice. If a model has both Strong and Weak traits, the effects of both are cancelled. This trait may be further modified to specify weapons or Descriptors of weapon, e.g. Strong [Melee].

Stupid: This model cannot declare Wait, Disengage, Scenario or any Complex Actions.

Swarm: This model has a -1 dice penalty on size tests. Ranged attacks targeting this model suffer an additional +1 to the Challenge Number.

### T
Tactician (X): This model adds X dice when it performs Tactical Tests.

Terror: If a model makes a Fear test caused by this model it must re-roll the test if it succeeds. Models must only re-roll the same test once due to this trait. If a model with the Bravery trait makes a Fear test caused by this 
model the effects of both traits are cancelled.

Tiny: This model is Tiny sized. Models Targeting this model with a Ranged Attack add a +1 modifier to the Challenge Number of the test. This model rolls one dice for Size Tests.

Tireless: This model does not remove an activation counter as a result of Melee Exchanges initiated by Enemy models.

Tough (X): When this model would suffer Wounds from any source reduce the final number of Wounds by X (If X is negative, instead you will increase the number of wounds taken).

### U
Unblockable (X): During this model’s Melee Exchanges the Enemy model must remove its X highest Defence dice rolled before the final Defence result is calculated.

Unstable: This model treats each inch moved in Difficult Terrain elements as 4” rather than 2”. If a model with this trait gains the Lightfooted Trait, it counts as having neither trait.

### V
Vengeance [Descriptor]: This model’s melee weapons gain Brutal (+1) and +1 Melee Strength when resolving a melee exchange against a [Descriptor] Model.

Virtue (X”): Once per turn during this model’s activation, it may give a target friendly Faction, non-Soulless, non-Insignificant model within X” a Virtue Token. A model may only have one Virtue Token at any time. A model may spend a Virtue Token at any time it could use an Instant Ki Feat. The benefits of spending the Token depend on the models in play. A model may benefit from only one Virtue bonus per Token unless otherwise stated.

### W
Weak: This model makes Size Tests at -l Dice . When this model makes a Damage Roll, roll 3D6 and choose the two lowest dice . If a model has both Strong and Weak traits, the effects of both are cancelled.

Willpower (X): Mnis model modifies the result by X when calculating its final result in Opposed Ki tests when it is the Activating model.

# Terrain
Terrain elements are categorised by three traits: Passage, Visibility and Size. When Terrain is described, these are listed as [Passage, Visibility, Size].

## Passage
How easy is it for a model to move through?
Impassable: Cannot be moved through.
Difficult: Can be moved through but each inch counts as 2 inches moved for any movement whilst within the Terrain element for models making a Walk, Melee, Run, or Charge. If Enhancing terrain has a sheer drop, this is usually Difficult terrain and being pushed, Slammed or Thrown from that Huge Enhancing terrain leaves a model Prone and after any damage roll the damage is not halved.
Normal: No effect to movement.
Ideal: Ideal terrain, such as adequately paved roads or the like can aid in movement. While making walk, run or charges if it crosses the Ideal Terrain at any point then it can add an extra 2” to its total move distance. We suggest Ideal terrain only apply to individual terrain items. If you play on a board with paving marked all over it, do not count the whole table as ideal!
Players should decide before the game starts if any areas of a Terrain element are different.

## Visibility
Can the Terrain element be seen through when drawing Line of Sight?
Clear: No effect on LoS.
Blocking: No LoS can be drawn through any part of the Terrain element that is considered Blocking. If any Los is blocked to the target by Blocking terrain (Assuming there is a clear LoS past the terrain) then the target benefits from Cover if it is within 1” of the terrain piece.
Obscuring: If any Line of Sight to any part of a target’s base is drawn through Obscuring terrain, then the target benefits from cover if it is within 1” of the terrain piece.
Enhancing: Models on hilly terrain or otherwise elevated gain Reach on their Melee Weapons for melee exchanges where a non-Cloudwalk opponent did not begin it’s activation on the same terrain as they hold the high ground. In addition, they ignore models and terrain smaller than the Enhancing terrain for LoS (Though such terrain can still provide cover if a LoS passes through them).

## Size
A terrain element’s size is what is physically represented on the table - but should be agreed upon by both players before the start of the game if either player considers it likely that the Size of a particular piece of terrain might be unclear. 
If players cannot agree on the size of a terrain element, by default the Size of a piece of terrain (As with models, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large or Huge) to be the Size of the smallest base it can fit on. If it is too big for a 50mm base, it is Huge. Some Clear terrain has no Size (Water for example) and is listed as Size Zero. Given this definitive test, it should be possible to define the Size of a piece of terrain during the game, as and when it becomes relevant to gameplay. This does not work for some elements, e.g. walls, so it is only to decide when players cannot agree on odd items of terrain. In a Tournament situation, ask the organiser. 
For Blocking terrain pieces where it is intended that LOS can be drawn over them, then these should be classified as Tiny, such that it is possible to gain Cover, but LOS is not blocked.
These rules are designed to allow you to use these traits to represent any terrain collection. Walls, for example, can vary in height depending on how they have been modeled.
A wall could be anywhere from a knee-high garden wall [Difficult, Blocking, Tiny] up to a formidable city wall [Difficult, Blocking, Huge].
If your bamboo forests are thick with bamboo you could make them [Impassable, Blocking] rather than the more sparse [Difficult, Obscuring].
Discuss the terrain with your opponent or have a good selection available so you can both choose fun and entertaining pieces for set up
We would recommend that before a game starts, each player highlights any terrain pieces where they consider the size classification may not be totally clear, in particular, whether a terrain piece might be either Tiny or Small, or Large or Huge, and discuss and agree on this with their opponent. 
Remember the rules are made to be definitive. A simple check with a gaming laser should solve all cover and LoS issues and while they may not always make sense, based on how the model looks from a “Model’s Eye View”, remember that the static model is representing a soldier who may be actively trying to hug terrain or keep a low profile.

Some Terrain is bought as a Special Card, and these terrain types are either cards deployed on the table, or on a stated base size. They have Visibility and Passage traits like all terrain and usually have other rules and can even have model traits.

## Terrain set up
A good table set up has at least 5-6 pieces of different terrain depending on the size of the terrain. Lots of terrain, each covering a smaller area, is better than fewer large pieces. We recommend including at least one of each of:

- [Impassable, Blocking, Huge] terrain, such as a boulder or house.
- [Difficult, Clear, Zero] terrain such as water or tilled fields
- [Difficult, Obscuring, Large] such as a bamboo forest
Then add other items.
Impassable Terrain cannot be deployed within 2” of Scenario Objectives or other impassable terrain. Try to avoid placing it in the area of a scenario or deployment zone. Terrain should be 2” from the edge of the table, but if you have very large items of terrain, these can often be best used by placing them half on the table rather than occupying most of the play area with them.
Other terrain can be set up as you wish but not in contact with other terrain or overlapping. The terrain should be equally spread around the table.

# Scenario Rules
Bushido is best enjoyed by playing a Scenario. Whilst beating your opponent into the ground until the last man is standing is fun, especially when learning the rules, there will come a time when you want to explore the full strategically challenging potential that Bushido has to offer.

## Type
All Scenarios have a Type: Scenario Objectives or Zone Control. Types are linked to the scoring of Victory Points (VP’s) in Scenarios, how this is achieved is dependent on the Scenario and explained under its Victory Conditions.

### Scenario Objectives
These are terrain elements on the battlefield that players must attempt to interact with. Scenario Objectives are one of three Alignments (Friendly, Neutral or Enemy) this can be shown on the board by turning the Scenario Objective to face the player’s Deployment Zone to whom it is Friendly or neither showing it is Neutral. If a Scenario Objective is Friendly to a player, then his Opponent considers it Enemy.
In Scenarios, players can use their models to interact with Scenario Objectives through Scenario actions. The effect is detailed under Scenario Objective Interactions. All Scenario Objectives are considered Blocking and Impassable Terrain elements unless specified in the Scenario.

### Scenario Objective Interactions
Players can interact with Scenario Objectives by taking Simple or Complex Scenario actions  The action needed, Simple or Complex, will be in brackets after the Scenario Objective Interaction. For example: Influence (Simple). The effect of an action depends on the Scenario Objective Interaction of the Scenario.
If there is more than one Interaction available to the model, then the controlling player decides which to use. Only those Interactions outlined in a Scenario can be used. The Interactions will appear as Keywords and are as follows:
Influence (Simple/Complex): The player changes the Alignment of a Scenario Objective one Degree (Enemy - Neutral - Friendly).

Prayer (X) (Simple/Complex): Each player starts the game with X Prayer Tokens. These are placed in a Prayer Pool for each player. The player removes one Prayer Token from their Prayer Pool and scores Scenario Points (SP’s). The number of SP’s scored depends on the Alignment of the Scenario Objective the model is in BtB with.

Friendly = 1 Scenario Point
Neutral = 2 Scenario Points
Enemy = 3 Scenario Points
A model may only declare a Scenario action once per Objective in any Turn.
Worship (Simple/Complex): The Controller of the model that performs this Scenario Objective Interaction places a Worship marker next to the Scenario Objective in BtB with the model. If the Scenario Objective’s Alignment would be reset instead remove a Worship marker.
Some Scenarios will have additional rules denoted by the following Keywords and their rules are detailed as follows:
Decreasing (Popular): During the End Phase of a Turn after scoring VP’s remove a Scenario Objective on which most Simple Scenario actions were taken. In the event of a tied number of Simple Scenario actions on Scenario Objectives, the scoring player’s Opponent decides which to remove.
Decreasing (Scorer): During the End Phase of a Turn after scoring VP’s remove a Scenario Objective which is Friendly to the player who scored the VP. The scoring player’s Opponent decides which to remove if there is more than one available.
Reset (X/X): During the Starting Phase of Turns X and X reset each player’s Scenario Points total to 0.
Reset Influence (X/X): During the Starting Phase of Turns X and X reset the Alignment of all Scenario Objectives to Neutral.

### Zone Control
In these scenarios, there are areas on the board that the players must battle to Control. A player Controls a Zone if they have a higher Rice Cost of models entirely within the Zone’s area and have more models completely within the Zone’s area than their Opponent. A player gains a number of Scenario Points equal to the Alignment of the Zone during the End Phase.

Friendly = 1 SP
Neutral = 2 SP
Enemy = 3 SP

## Deployment
This section outlines the deployment of the players’ models and if necessary any Scenario Objectives. For models, Deployment can be either Baseline or Corner Square Deployment. This is the area that the players will deploy their models.

Baseline Deployment: Models are set up with the base of the model touching the edge of the board.

Corner Square Deployment: Players set up their models completely within a 6” square in opposite corners of the board.

If the Scenario uses Scenario Objectives, then players should place them on the board as instructed under this section of the Scenario explanation in conjunction with the Scenario’s diagram. Objectives with the same colour as your deployment zone are Friendly. Uncoloured Objectives are Neutral.
The Scenario Objective’s base size will appear in brackets. There are three different base sizes: Small, Medium and Large.
If you can’t deploy all of your models due to insufficient space, you are permitted to remove any impassable terrain that restricts your deployment space.
If you find you still cannot fit all models that need to be deployed in the deployment zone, models not deployed are removed from play.

## Game Length
The length of a game of Bushido can be Fixed or Variable and lasts a number of Turns detailed below. The game ends in the End Phase of the last turn or in the End Phase after one player has no models left in play.  If either player has no models left in play, calculate Scenario Points and Victory Points, and then determine the final score. Once this is done, the game ends.
Variable (X): During the Starting Phase of Turn (X) one of the players rolls a single D6. If the result is 4 or more, the game will finish at the end of the Turn, If not then the game continues to the next Turn when this roll will be made again. The game will always finish after the End Phase of the seventh Turn.

Fixed (X): The game finishes after the End Phase of the designated Turn (X).

## Victory Conditions
Each Scenario has three Victory Points (VP’s) available to the players. At the end of the game, the player who has scored the highest number of VP’s is the winner. If both players have scored an equal number of VP’s, then the game is a draw. Only 3 VPs can be scored in any scenario, so both players VP scores combined will always be three or less.

# Keii
The remaining leagues have been nothing but a blanket of emerald rice paddies and dusty dykes crisscrossing the land. You have been greeted by the lowing of half-submerged water buffalo and the friendly chatter of wrinkled farmers on your way to the grove. At the edge of freshly ploughed fields, swaying palm trees mark the villages and waterholes, while a constant blue haze in the distance, points to where the mountains are. The evenings are an explosion of fireflies, sparks, and stars while the dawn wraps you in ghostly mist and scatters a billion diamonds at your weary feet.  After a few more days you find what you have been looking for. 
The power here is palpable, it makes your skin prickle and your hairs rise, and it smells like the air during a lightning storm. Before you, in the middle of the glade, are six stone lanterns laid out in a circle. Some are crooked and broken, but all are wrapped in vines and moss and rise from the ground like the bones of a hastily buried corpse. The forest is silent, too silent. From the other side of the glade comes the unmistakable sound of a dry branch snapping under a misplaced footstep. It seems you’re not alone. From out of the trees and bushes come the distinct silhouettes of your mortal enemies readying themselves for the fight.

Your heart beats wildly as the sweat stings your eyes. This is it, no time for discussion or conversation. You try to banish the galloping thoughts from your mind as you and your Warband take to the field. The melee swirls all around you, a constant ebb and flow as both sides try to find a weakness in the other’s defence; if it weren’t so deadly, it could almost be a dance, but it is, and so it becomes a dance of death.  Killer instinct takes control, as the sun flashes off sword and steel. Blood sprays and men scream in abject terror. Your nerves hum and your lungs burn, and your heart booms in your ears like a temple gong. Your mouth is bone dry, your tongue like wood and the memory of water so very far away. There is a slight tremble in your hands that must also be defeated. The smell of kicked-up dust and grass are in your nose. You take a deep breath looking left and right for your closest foe. Everything slows, you are above it, looking down, reading the battlefield, studying it, knowing it like one knows the faces of the ones they love. There, in the middle, if victory is to be yours, then it must be held at all cost. No time to wait, you have to push on through. You must be bold and resolute, a rock for your enemy to crash and break upon!

# Idols
Even in the dry season, the trails are muddy. Under the humid jungle canopy, spears of sunlight intersperse the darkness bathing everything in a mottled, twilight green. It’s hard to see where you are going. Bamboo thickets and patches of elephant grass dot the sides of the winding trail, while blade-grass slices at your face and hands. Mosquitoes and leeches attack with impunity, attaching themselves to wherever they can. Everything is tangled together in one sizeable mass of vegetation, and what may be lurking behind those fronds and oversized leaves is anyone’s guess. Things rustle and slither in the undergrowth, and the air is heavy and wet. Sluggish streams and strange animal calls break the monotony of the trail, and before you know it, the ancient temple lies before you. Strange stone faces peer accusingly at you and your Warband from behind curtains of thick jungle vines. The canopy opens and direct sunlight streams down into the clearing, and there, basking in its rays, like a cobra sunning itself on a rock, are three stone idols of immense power. These squat, toad-like carvings are what you have come here to find. You ready yourselves for the ceremony but are surprised by a flock of birds exploding into the sky as someone, or perhaps something approaches....
