# Risen Sun Printed Rulebooks
Nearly-raw text of each print run of the Bushido Risen Sun rulebook, for diff and reference purposes.
The focus is on preserving rules content as-printed. Some formatting changes have been made to aid legibility, where rules are materially unaffected.
Minimal markdown has been used to format headings and tables, to aid navigation, but not for font effects etc.

The following items have been removed:
- table of contents
- page references and accompanying text
- lore sections at the back of the book
- reference sheets
